Nobody knows who her parents are.\n\nWhen she was only an infant, Lachesis was adopted by the nobleman Nigella, who had only just ventured from his home. He believed that this was the will of the gods, and became determined to cultivate Lachesis into a fine young lady.\n\nIt gradually became evident that Lachesis was different from other children. She possessed a strong memory, and never forgot a single thing, plus her ability to understand things and retain knowledge was far beyond the capabilities of any ordinary person. Even when she did as she was told, she failed to deviate even slightly from the specified words uttered to her.\n\nAfter more than ten years under the protective guardianship of her father, the public at large also came to see that she was extraordinary, and even the Church invited her to become a holy maiden.\n\nAnd so, Lachesis became a nun in her adult years, developing a yearning and curiosity for \"God,\" and a desire to discover the source of her ability.","text_elite_1002":"As a holy maiden, Lachesis's daily duty involved worshipping the Church's treasured relic—the sacred scriptures.\n\nBut what no one knew was that Lachesis could communicate directly with the scriptures, and could freely browse all the information contained within them.\n\nIt was only then that she realized the vastness of the world and the history of this mainland.\n\nDuring her studies one day, Lachesis learned from an old scroll that a powerful Demon, sealed underground outside of the town, had once wrought havoc upon the world, and that for hundreds of years, those wishing to overturn the order of the world had been planning to break the seal and release this Demon.\n\nLachesis had a hunch that after one month had passed, a rare solar eclipse would take place. The seal would be broken, the Demon would awaken, and its minions would come swarming out.\n\nIn an instant, people everywhere would be plunged into unimaginable torment.\n\nLachesis finally realized the significance of her birth there and then, and she removed the sacred scriptures from the church.\n\nUsing the magic words she had learned from the scriptures, she razed her own life, her own soul, and used the power of the relic to apply the seal anew, destroying all of the Demons.\n\nThose she had saved only saw that the holy maiden had become a ray of light infused into the Church's relic. After the light reached a dazzling radiance, all became calm.","text_elite_1003":"Goddess's eyes were indeed fixed upon the girl. Though she thought that her short life was over, she was blessed by Goddess's holy favor.\n\nThe Goddess descended. She renewed her soul with holy light, reformed her body with pure energy, and endowed her with the compassion and knowledge of divinity.\n\nHer warm golden light dissipated, and a new Divine was born.\n\nShe found herself on a snowy plain once again. Before her, a huge floating book opened. Lachesis knelt down on it, her eyes closed with fathomless tranquility, and her mind alive with the knowledge of the universe.\n\n...\n\n\"My child, your mission to be born and live among the people of this realm is now complete. Now, your life begins.\"","text_elite_2001":"Dorabella the Ethereal Valkyrie, was born into a wealthy family in the Imperial City of Tiras. She was a passionate and willful child, fueled by a mind filled with pure curiosity.\n\nIt was during art class that Dorabella showed her amazing talent for magic for the very first time. She animated a sculpted crow through the power of her mind and watched as it spread its wings and flew away. After this, rumors of a mage with unique talents quickly spread throughout the city, and Dorabella began to attract the attention of all.\n\nAt the same time, she also came under the scrutiny of certain members of the citizenry who had always been afraid of magic. Some people even preached that her innate magic was not a blessing, but a curse, doomed to bring disaster.\n\nAs if to confirm these ominous words, Dorabella found herself embroiled in a heated conflict at her school's graduation ball. Overwhelmed by anger and adolescent anxiety, she released a powerful burst of magic as her emotions flowed from her. In the end, the roof of the dance hall was torn asunder by her uncontainable power, and the whole scene was a picture of pure chaos.\n\nHer parents grew worried about her untamed magical potential. Although the naturally optimistic Dorabella seemed indifferent to the situation, she still followed her parents' instructions and traveled to the Dawn City, seeking help from the Mage Council...","text_elite_2002":"During her time with the Mage Council, Dorabella quickly stood out from the crowd of mage apprentices, relying on her outstanding talent and abilities. However, she was always unwilling to accept the rigid doctrines of the mages and remained true to her free-spirited nature.\n\nShe would often sneak away from the council to travel the world. The helpful Dorabella enjoyed using her still inexperienced \"Ethereal Power\" to aid those in distress, but this also caused headaches for the Mage Council.\n\nHer mentor, Liddell, crafted a magical bracelet for Dorabella to help her control her powers. As a result, Dorabella's powers were restrained while Liddell's magic grew stronger day by day, quickly becoming a highly regarded Archmage within the Mage Council and soon to be granted the title of the \"Ethereal\" mage.\n\nOn the day of the ceremony, Dorabella disrupted the secret ritual, sanctioning her mentor and, in front of everyone, seized the staff that symbolized the \"Ethereal Mage\" – Lirayesh...","text_elite_2003":"\"Is the Ethereal Power a blessing or a disaster?\"\n\nOn the surface, Dorabella always displayed an indifferent attitude to fend off others' accusations. However, deep within, this question still troubled her frequently. With age and experience, her fear of her own power quietly deepened.\n\nAt that time, the Era of Calamity arrived, and the empire was being invaded by the forces of the Abyss.\n\nDorabella once again stepped forward, facing the forces of the Abyss alone. In the end, she unleashed the mighty \"Ethereal Power\" to defeat the Abyss. However, she also came dangerously close to losing control due to the overwhelming power.\n\nIntense pain spread throughout her body as Dorabella's \"Ethereal Power\" went berserk, causing the abyssal fissure to spread and pollute the entire Foggy Jungle.\n\nAt this critical moment, the Omniguardian appeared just in time and used the \"Eternal Oath\" to suppress Dorabella's \"Ethereal Power,\" preventing the disaster from escalating.\n\nSeeing the catastrophe she had caused, Dorabella was filled with regret.\n\nBut the Omniguardian granted her forgiveness, saying, \"The Ethereal Power is a blessing bestowed upon you by the oath. You have not abused its power, and you should be proud of it.\"\n\nFrom then on, Dorabella remembered the Omniguardian's teachings and began to develop feelings of admiration...","text_elite_3001":"The \"Guardian Valkyrie\" Eluller was born into a noble family in the Northern Realm. Her family hoped that she would become an outstanding lady, marrying into the royal family to gain political advantages for the family. However, Eluller grew tired of the constraints imposed on women by high society and resented the rigid teachings of the nobles.\n\nWith a strong and determined personality, she yearned to become a warrior and win glory on the battlefield like her ancestors. To prove herself equal to the boys, Eluller behaved like one from a young age, learning swordsmanship and horse riding.\n\nAt the age of 14, her father made her a promise: if she could plant the family's flag on the peak of the Northern Highland before sunset, he would allow her to undergo training and become a true warrior of the North. Overcoming the fierce blizzards on the highland, Eluller fulfilled the promise with her unwavering determination. Her father was moved by her unwavering spirit and fulfilled his promise, personally teaching her swordsmanship and nurturing her into an exceptional warrior.","text_elite_3002":"Eluller always remembers the pivotal moment when she first encountered the Omniguardian. It was the most important turning point in her life.\n\nDuring that time in the Northern Realm, the abyssal forces were rampant. Eluller's parents led the soldiers in a desperate battle against the abyss, but tragically lost their lives in the conflict. As Eluller found herself in despair and helplessness, the Omniguardian suddenly appeared, suppressing the Abyssal demons and protecting the safety of the local people.\n\nFilled with gratitude and admiration for the Omniguardian's generous rescue, Eluller made a vow to pledge her loyalty. She vowed to learn combat skills and eradicate the abyssal forces once and for all. From that moment on, Eluller left her homeland and embarked on a journey, following the Omniguardian.\n\nInfluenced by the Omniguardian, Eluller also adopted their stance of guardianship and dedicated herself to battle, protecting those in need. Through her displayed courage and sense of justice, she gradually earned the respect of the people on the continent, leaving behind numerous legends.","text_elite_3003":"The redemption day is approaching, and Eluller has been entrusted by the Omniguardian with the solemn duty of guarding Mirlond.\n\nFor many years, she has faithfully protected the peace of this land. Despite the passing of time and the changes in the world, she has remained steadfast in her vows, always safeguarding the safety of Mirlond.\n\nNo matter how challenging the times may be, she fears no formidable foes, bravely defending the people of the Mythoria. With unwavering loyalty and admiration for the Omniguardian, she fights for the peace of Mirlond.\n\nTo Eluller, the existence of the Omniguardian is a symbol of faith, hope, and light. After millennia of vigilance, she still yearns for the day when the Omniguadian will awaken again, bringing new hope to this world once more.\n\n\"I shall uphold my promise, guarding Mirlond with my life, until the Omniguardian rise again...\"","text_elite_4001":"Even in the vast continent of Itheron, some races are exceedingly rare, and Demons are among them. Legend has it that Demons can seduce and subjugate any being, ultimately trapping them in a maze of desire to serve their whims. During the twin calamities that swept through Itheron, the Demon Aiushtha proclaimed her genesis: \"The strongest among you shall receive my kiss.\" Low-ranking celestial beings thus turned on each other in a frenzy. Days later, Aiushtha approached the last one standing, lifted his face, bestowed a reward-like gentle kiss, then with a single hand, moved downward, snapping his neck. The Demon's enslaved lay helpless on the ground, with comrades seething in envy, a dagger he had thrust into his chest.\n\nAiushtha, born with a pair of ruby-like rare and beautiful magic eyes, took pride in how these gems shattered countless fragile wills during war. She referred to the captives beneath her as \"pets,\" and they reveled in the title. After the war, Aiushtha was hailed as the supreme ruler by the Omniguardian, yet the tranquil Itheron left her bored, so the Demon descended upon Palmarius.\n\nUpon her first entry into the human realm, Aiushtha marveled at their creativity. Compared to the rough, meager craftsmanship of the demonic offspring, human designs were uniquely ingenious, especially the artisans of the Kingdom of Rhea, renowned worldwide. Aiushtha thoroughly enjoyed the exquisite garments and lavish lifestyle, all, of course, footed by her \"pets.\"\n\nAiushtha was well aware that her followers were captivated by the Demon's powers, a fact she cared little about until misfortune befell the Kingdom of Rhea.","text_elite_4002":"At a noble ball, Aiushtha was introduced to the king of the Kingdom of Rhea and swiftly became a distinguished guest in the royal court. Both inside and outside the palace, there were numerous suspicions about Aiushtha's presence, but the Demon paid little attention to human thoughts. The only issue was that Aiushtha discovered the king's son seemed to resist the power of her magic eyes. The prince repeatedly confessed his love to Aiushtha, who, in turn, repeatedly confirmed that her magic eyes had not taken control of him. This left her feeling refreshed and somewhat bewildered. The Demon couldn't understand: if her magic eyes had no effect, why did he look like this?\n\n\"I am different from those pets captured by your abilities, Aiushtha. I love you just because you are you.\"\n\n\"Such love is the purest and most enduring, isn't it?\"\n\nThe prince held Aiushtha tightly, pleading for her help to ascend to the throne and promising her that his queen could change into a magnificent and expensive gown every day.\n\n\"Anything you desire, Aiushtha, I will procure for you if possible.\" He gently kissed those bright red eyes.\n\nUsing her magic eyes, Aiushtha swept away all obstacles for the prince, including the old king. Shortly after the funeral, the prince held his coronation ceremony, and the Kingdom of Rhea welcomed a new king and queen. True to his promise, the new king had a magnificent dress presented to the queen every day.\n\nAt that time, the Abyss began to emerge, disasters frequented Palmarius, and the Kingdom of Rhea was not spared. The murmurs about the queen's dresses spread, and public grievances intensified. The king, citing busy affairs of state, almost stopped meeting Aiushtha. She felt extremely irritated, a feeling she had never experienced when she was in Itheron.\n\nThis restlessness didn't last long. Soon, the king appeared before Aiushtha. Just as she was trying to understand why she felt joy at the king's presence, he announced that she would be sentenced to death, stating that the Kingdom of Rhea could not tolerate a queen who brought disaster to the people. Joy instantly cooled into anger, and Aiushtha found it hard to believe that humans could so easily betray their promises. Burning with rage, Aiushtha wanted to kill the man in front of her but inexplicably couldn't bring herself to do it.\n\n\"Do you know what people call you? They call you the \"Doomsday Valkyrie\"! Aiushtha, as the king of Rhea, I cannot allow you to harm my people any longer. I must execute you.\"\n\n\"Oh? They believe I brought misfortune upon them?\" The Demon felt puzzled. She frowned slightly, as she had done countless times before, reaching out to touch the king's face. \"From beginning to end, all desires, all cravings, stem from you. Your Highness, you are the source of misfortune.\" Hearing this, the king's face, initially showing reluctance, twisted in response. \"You devil, dare to slander the king!\" His Majesty waved his hand, signaling the guards to imprison Aiushtha.\n\nThe Demon's eyes turned blood-red, like blood itself.","text_elite_4003":"On the night Aiushtha was sentenced to death by the king of Rhea, the Malevolent Mother seized the opportunity to invade her mind. Infected by the power of the Abyss, Aiushtha descended into madness. By the time the sun rose the next day, there was not a single living soul left in the entire palace. It was said that those who entered the palace that day fainted upon witnessing the horrific scene inside and never woke up. The kingdom, now without its royal family, plunged into immense chaos, with wars erupting, and the people suffering. The name of the \"Doomsday Valkyrie\" spread throughout Palmarius. However, instead of experiencing the joy of revenge, Aiushtha was overwhelmed by a strange emptiness.\n\nShe became the only Demon in the world yearning for true love. For a Demon, this was almost a curse.\n\nWhen the Omniguardian encountered Aiushtha again, she was still tormented by the power of the Abyss. The Abyssal corruption and Aiushtha's inner pain fueled each other, and everywhere her magic eyes swept, was tainted with blood. After defeating her, the Omniguardian cleansed Aiushtha of the Abyssal corruption and appointed her as the Doomsday Valkyrie.\n\n\"From now on, you shall atone in the name of the Doomsday Valkyrie, Aiushtha,\" the Omniguardian said.\n\nAiushtha, still recovering from the pain, weakly opened her eyes. The upright figure reflected in those ruby-like gems was strangely reminiscent of the moment she was proclaimed the supreme ruler a thousand years ago. Aiushtha understood the mistake she had made: she shouldn't have demanded ephemeral humans to abide by eternal vows.\n\nSubsequently, the Omniguardian fell into a deep slumber on the atonement day, but Aiushtha knew that he would return one day. If she could conquer the Omniguardian, who was immune to the influence of her magic eyes and almost immortal, would she finally find satisfaction? With this hope in her heart, the Doomsday Valkyrie awaited the awakening of the Omniguardian.","text_elite_5001":"Diana was once part of the Woodland Temple and an advocate of its teachings of \"balance.\"\n\nBut when she saw for herself the numerous atrocities that humanity committed against the Woodland,\n\nshe eventually cast aside the temple's intransigent doctrines\n\nand chose to become a lone ranger instead.\n\nThese days, she can be found weaving through the Woodland\n\nwith her bow in hand and her heart full of resolve to protect her homeland.","text_elite_5002":"Diana may have left the Woodland Temple, but she did not cut off all contact with her old friends from the temple.\n\nAfter all, they were on the same page when it came to defending the Woodland.\n\nMerida the Woodland Priestess has been persuading Diana to return to the Woodland Temple, but to no avail.\n\nSylvan, the leader of the Twilight Guards, has always had this rebellious girl on her radar, even extending an olive branch to her on multiple occasions.\n\nBut because the Twilight Guards have an alliance with the Woodland Temple, Diana never once accepted Sylvan's invitation.\n\nToday, Diana continues to roam the dense Woodland as a ranger, intimidating and punishing anyone who attempts to bring harm to the Woodland.","text_elite_5003":"Merlin, the Woodland Temple's oracle, was once Diana's respected mentor. The two fell out over an irreparable disagreement in ideas.\n\nIt was a natural disaster that planted the seed of discord between them.

This, in turn, left devastating damage in the Woodland.\n\nDiana wanted to protect her homeland and was in favor of expelling these humans by force. Merlin, however, urged her to restrain herself, for he believed it was necessary to maintain a harmonious \"balance\" between Woodland and humanity.\n\nThe duke of Sunsethold jumped at the opportunity to gain an unfair advantage, abetting his people to capture the Woodland's citizens as leverage. His immoral act turned out to be the last straw for Diana.\n\nOut of anger, she fired an arrow that put an end to both his life and scheming ambition—one that Merlin unappreciatively berated her for. Merlin prophesied that Diana's recklessness will bring irreversible damage to the harmonious relationship between Woodland and humanity.\n\nRather than maintaining peace between the races, Diana staunchly chose to expel these humans by force, not forgetting to deride Merlin's teachings of \"balance\" as foolish.\n\nThis difference between them eventually prompted Diana to part ways with her mentor.","text_elite_6001":"Elune was the leader of the harpy tribe and also served as the Valkyrie protecting the Woodland.

I don't know how to begin because it's slightly complicated.","text_story_31089":"I'm grateful for this power, even though I do not know why the Creator chose me.","text_story_31090":"Nevertheless, it has given me the ability and opportunity to rescue my sister and save this world.","text_story_31091":"I can't deny this.","text_story_31092":"After all, what warrior has not fantasized about becoming a hero and an omniguardian?","text_story_31093":"However, I am quite worried...","text_story_31094":"I do not know what we will face in the future...","text_story_31095":"Are you afraid?","text_story_31096":"......","text_story_31097":"I'm not afraid of battle, nor am I afraid of sacrifice.","text_story_31098":"However, I do not wish to see the people whom I cherish get hurt.","text_story_31099":"I raise my weapon so that they do not have to raise any.","text_story_31100":"Therefore...","text_story_31101":"I will stand by your side until we achieve the ultimate victory.","text_story_31102":"You won't let me down, right?","text_story_31103":"(As the conversation deepens, Eluller drinks goblet after goblet of mellow wine.)","text_story_31104":"(Unbeknownst to her, signs of tipsiness have crept onto her cheeks and her eyes.)","text_story_31105":"Oh, forgive my chattiness today, for I have little opportunity to share my thoughts with others when I'm in the army.","text_story_31106":"Thank you for keeping me company.","text_story_31107":"Perhaps, if given the chance, we can have some fun in the future—you and me, together.","text_story_31108":"Now, excuse me for a while. I need to find a place to...","text_story_31109":"Blech...","text_story_31110":"Remember to stay away from the ditch.","text_story_31111":"......","text_story_31112":"Thank you for the reminder.","text_story_31113":"Alright, we'll end this topic for now.

But just as your discussion is coming to an end, you suddenly hear a piercing sound from behind you. Something seems to be swiftly approaching.)","text_story_81005":"(Then, you hear Eluller's warning.)","text_story_81007":"Watch your back!","text_story_81008":"(It is a pity that the warning was a little too late. Right after Eluller's shout, you feel something fall onto your neck.)","text_story_81009":"What do you plan to do now?","text_story_81010":"Reach out to touch...","text_story_81011":"(You reach behind and feel your neck with your hand, trying to figure out what it is.)","text_story_81012":"(Even before you managed to touch the thing, the sensation of a foreign object on your neck suddenly vanishes. You feel a cold tingle burrow under your skin.)","text_story_81013":"What in the world was that?","text_story_81014":"Remain still.","text_story_81015":"(As you do not know what the thing is, you choose not to move.)","text_story_81016":"(At the very next moment, the sensation of a foreign object on your neck suddenly vanishes. You feel a cold tingle burrow under your skin.)","text_story_81017":"What in the world was that?","text_story_81018":"(Eluller and Dorabella walk behind you to examine the thing on your neck.)","text_story_81019":"Is this your new tattoo? It looks very... em... stylish?","text_story_81020":"What tattoo?","text_story_81021":"It's a black and red pattern that has wings...","text_story_81022":"It looks similar to the thing that flew by just now. It seems to be... a moth? Yes, it's a moth.","text_story_81023":"Moth? Could it be Arkdina?","text_story_81024":"Why would she do that?","text_story_81025":"(You deeply ponder.)","text_story_81026":"(Eluller touches the weird pattern on the back of your neck with her fingers.)","text_story_81027":"(Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain where Eluller touched.)","text_story_81028":"(The sudden pain makes you cry out uncontrollably.)","text_story_81029":"Are you okay?","text_story_81030":"(Dorabella also examines the back of your neck.)","text_story_81031":"A typical marking spell. Arkdina placed a mark on you.","text_story_81032":"Do you need my help to get rid of it? I can perhaps use my sword to slice it out. However you might have to bear with the pain.","text_story_81033":"(Eluller draws her sword as she speaks.)","text_story_81034":"!!!","text_story_81035":"Decline","text_story_81036":"Decline again","text_story_81037":"(You politely decline Eluller's offer and calmly push Eluller's sword back into its sheath.)","text_story_81038":"I don't feel any malice from this mark. She probably doesn't plan to harm you.","text_story_81039":"(Dorabella seems to recall something as she looks at you and laughs.)","text_story_81040":"Perhaps she wants to use this mark to declare her ownership of you?","text_story_81041":"Oh, it's a little strange, but also a little cute.","text_story_81042":"Just like the wolves at the tundra, marking their territory?","text_story_81043":"Declaring to who? Us?","text_story_81044":"(Laughs) Perhaps. There're too many girls around you.","text_story_81045":"......","text_story_81046":"(You're uncertain of what Arkdina wants. After thinking for a moment, you decide to go and look for her.)","text_story_81048":"(You arrive at Arkdina's residence. Even though the Valkyrie Pact has been signed, Arkdina does not seem to like interacting with the other Valkyries.)","text_story_81050":"(As you follow the path, you soon come before a massive pool of blood.)","text_story_81051":"(The viscous blood-red liquid swirls before your eyes. Surprisingly, the odor of the liquid is not overwhelming. Instead, you smell an unfamiliar fragrance.)","text_story_81053":"Arkdina——!","text_story_81054":"(As if aware of your arrival, the center of the blood pool begins to churn before forming a whirlpool.)","text_story_81055":"(A throne made of bones emerges from within the whirlpool, and Arkdina sits naked on the throne.)","text_story_81057":"(From the blood pool, dark mist rises up along Arkdina's slender legs. It climbs up her glistening body, and turns into clothing.)","text_story_81059":"(Arkdina looks down at you from above.)","text_story_81060":"Came to ask about the mark?","text_story_81061":"(Arkdina obviously knows what you are here for and does not beat around the bush.)","text_story_81062":"(You nod.)","text_story_81063":"This—is my return gift to you.","text_story_81065":"Doubtful","text_story_81066":"What do you mean?","text_story_81067":"(Arkdina points toward the Pact Seal on her body.)","text_story_81068":"Thank you for leaving such an ugly mark on my body.

Now we're even.","text_story_81071":"You should be thankful that I only gave you a mark and not a scar.","text_story_81072":"......","text_story_81073":"You've gotten the answer that you seek.

No matter how much you shout, the blood pool doesn't react.)","text_story_81080":"There's a tiny spell within the seal. If you encounter any danger, I'll be able to detect it immediately. I won't allow you to die by the hands of others.","text_story_81082":"Now scram.","text_story_81084":"……Arkdina, is this how you show your affection?","text_story_81085":"(You wait for some time but still do not get any response from within the blood pool.)","text_story_81086":"Alright, then I'll take that as a yes.","text_story_81087":"Dorabella was right. He's a little strange, but also a little cute.","text_story_81090":"... Thank you.","text_story_82001":"Oh no! Something bad has happened!","text_story_82002":"What happened?","text_story_82003":"Lachesis and Arkdina, the Divine and the Demon, are about to fight each other!","text_story_82004":"How could this have happened?!","text_story_82005":"I don't know either.

You can catch me then.","text_story_42025":"(Aiushtha's breathy voice sounds extremely seductive.)","text_story_42026":"What are you planning to do?","text_story_42027":"Try to wake up.","text_story_42028":"(You clear your head of the distracting thoughts and try to separate your consciousness from this dream.)","text_story_42029":"(You can never seem to wake up, no matter how hard you try.)","text_story_42030":"(You quickly realize that this must be one of Aiushtha's tricks.)","text_story_42031":"Haha—","text_story_42032":"I've told you before, darling.","text_story_42033":"An intelligent demon will not take risks if her weakness has already been exposed.","text_story_42034":"Refuse and question.","text_story_42035":"You've just said that being the intelligent devil you are, you will never take risks if your weakness has already been exposed before me.","text_story_42036":"My guess is that you came fully prepared. It won't be easy for me to wake up from this dream, will it?","text_story_42037":"Haha—","text_story_42038":"Smart and cautious, those are part of why I like you.","text_story_42039":"So what on earth are you trying to do?","text_story_42040":"Don't tell me a succubus is trying to be my slave out of nowhere.","text_story_42041":"You're not out of your mind, are you?","text_story_42042":"I see you like it direct. Fantastic, I shall come right out and say it then.","text_story_42043":"The last time, your dreams made me very comfortable, so I'm planning on staying here forever.","text_story_42044":"Here in your dreams, I can feel an unfathomable... darkness.","text_story_42045":"I'm deeply intrigued by it.","text_story_42046":"......","text_story_42047":"I don't think there's anything you have to worry about.","text_story_42048":"We've already signed a Valkyrie Pact. I won't be so foolish as to hurt you.","text_story_42049":"And if you happen to be willing, ","text_story_42050":"we can even have some fun together.","text_story_42051":"I'll make sure it'll be a time you'll never forget.","text_story_42052":"How does that sound, sweetheart?","text_story_42053":"Agree.","text_story_42054":"I knew you would come around to it.","text_story_42055":"(Aiushtha laughs coyly.)","text_story_42056":"Decline","text_story_42057":"Playing hard to get, huh?","text_story_42058":"Too bad I wasn't seeking your opinion. I was just informing you about it.","text_story_42059":"Alright, we're left with one last thing to do now.","text_story_42060":"I'm going to place a seal on our \"new pact\".","text_story_42061":"(Aiushtha smiles and leans in toward you.)","text_story_42062":"(She rests her palm on your chest and cups the back of your neck with her other hand.)","text_story_42063":"(You feel a tremor down your body as you take in the alluring scent of her body and feel her soft, supple skin.)","text_story_42064":"(Aiushtha's pouty lips closes in on yours—)","text_story_42065":"(She eventually presses her lips firmly against yours.)","text_story_42066":"Let's take our time to thoroughly enjoy this dream.","text_story_51001":"(Even though Diana has become a Valkyrie and joined your team, she is often nowhere to be found.)","text_story_51002":"(After not seeing her for several days straight, you decide to find out where she has gone.)","text_story_51003":"(After asking people on good terms with her, Merida and Sylvan, about her whereabouts, you arrive outside the Woodland.)","text_story_51004":"(This is the place where the Woodland borders the Empire.)","text_story_51005":"(According to them, there is a good chance that Diana can be found here.)","text_story_51006":"(Just as you are about to step into the Woodland, you hear a sudden but familiar shout...)","text_story_51007":"Stop! Proceed no further!","text_story_51008":"(You immediately stop walking and look in the direction of the yell.)","text_story_51009":"(Then you see Diana nimbly leaping down from atop a tree.)","text_story_51010":"That was close.","text_story_51011":"If you had walked even a step further, you would have destroyed my intricately-arranged trap.","text_story_51012":"Diana...","text_story_51013":"What are you doing?","text_story_51014":"As you can see, I'm...","text_story_51015":"Hunting.","text_story_51016":"What trap are you referring to?","text_story_51017":"The one by your feet.","text_story_51018":"It's meant for hunting.","text_story_51019":"What are you hunting?","text_story_51020":"Do rabbits eat meat these days?","text_story_51021":"If you'd like to know, you could give hunting a try with me.","text_story_51022":"Although I suspect that you'd probably not like it too much.","text_story_51023":"(Having finished speaking, Diana points at a tall tree at the side.)","text_story_51024":"Climb up. The hunt is about to begin.","text_story_51025":"Climb to the treetop","text_story_51026":"(Following Diana, you also climb to the top of the large tree.)","text_story_51027":"What now?","text_story_51028":"Conceal yourself, stay focused, and wait patiently.","text_story_51029":"(Diana squats down and focuses her attention on the ground below her.)","text_story_51030":"(Diana is indeed an excellent hunter. It's as if she is one with the Woodland.)","text_story_51031":"(If hadn't already known her position, it would've been impossible for you to discover her.)","text_story_51032":"(Therefore, you begin to imitate Diana's behavior and concentrate intensely as well.)","text_story_51033":"Patiently waiting...","text_story_51034":"(Time continues to tick by...)","text_story_51035":"(After some time, you see that Diana's slender ears abruptly twitch.)","text_story_51036":"(In a low voice) Someone's here.

Before long, they disappear completely.)","text_story_51052":"(Amid the chaos, the sacks that the two men were carrying on their shoulders fell to the ground.)","text_story_51053":"What are you doing?!","text_story_51054":"(Diana is extremely dissatisfied with your behavior.)","text_story_51055":"(Seeing that her hunt has failed, Diana sullenly leaps down from the tree.)","text_story_51056":"(You jump down after her.)","text_story_51057":"......","text_story_51058":"I know what you're thinking.","text_story_51059":"But before we start arguing, I hope that you will take a look at this first.","text_story_51060":"Wait and see","text_story_51061":"(After a brief moment of pondering, you ultimately decide that you will not take any actions for now.)","text_story_51062":"(The two hunters obliviously step onto Diana's trap.)","text_story_51063":"(Without warning, numerous vines emerge from the ground and tightly bind the two hunters' legs.)","text_story_51064":"(Immediately after, two arrows fly out of the treetop and pierce the two men in their chests!)","text_story_51065":"(The hunters let out blood-curdling screams as they collapse.

She belongs to the same race as Elune.","text_story_51082":"These people are poachers who specialize in capturing the young of rarely-seen races like the Harpies.","text_story_51083":"They sell these infants to other humans. The buyers either raise them or force them to fight in arenas for entertainment.","text_story_51084":"These two cretins have already destroyed dozens of Woodland families.","text_story_51085":"I have warned them once before, giving them a chance to turn over a new leaf.","text_story_51086":"However, they did not cherish the opportunity, so I did not intend to show them any mercy this time.","text_story_51087":"Express understanding","text_story_51088":"Express disapproval","text_story_51089":"Humans hunt, as do Woodland animals. There is nothing wrong with hunting for survival's sake.","text_story_51090":"However, I will never approve of hunting for sport.","text_story_51091":"Humans seem to take this for granted, which is why they hunt other animals without batting an eyelid.","text_story_51092":"However, they forget they're not the only hunters in this land.","text_story_51093":"Since they've decided to be hunters, they should be prepared to become the prey at any moment.","text_story_51094":"These are the rules which I abide by.","text_story_52001":"(Mirlond's training grounds are quite lively today.)","text_story_52002":"(Diana and Merida are hanging out together. Diana seems to be teaching Merida how to shoot a bow?)","text_story_52003":"(However, Merida looks rather unwilling...)","text_story_52004":"You missed the bullseye yet again. This shot doesn't count.","text_story_52005":"(Frustrated)... It's so difficult!!","text_story_52006":"Continue; it's not time for a break yet.","text_story_52007":"(Merida grimaces as she slowly draws a new arrow from her quiver and nocks it.)","text_story_52008":"Aim and... fire.","text_story_52009":"(Merida shoots yet another arrow.)","text_story_52010":"(As the arrow soars through the air at a slanted angle, it appears that it will miss the bullseye yet again.","text_story_52011":"(However, halfway through, the arrow's direction suddenly adjusts. Then it flies directly toward the red bullseye, firmly planting itself into the center of the target.)","text_story_52012":"(That's when you notice with your peripheral vision a subtle magical glow flashing across Merida's fingertips before disappearing in the next instant.)","text_story_52013":"(Excitedly) Yeah! Bullseye! Look, Diana!","text_story_52014":"(Diana stares silently at Merida.)","text_story_52015":"Amazing! And you did it without cheating, too.","text_story_52016":"(Merida looks discomfited by Diana's stare.)","text_story_52017":"Alright, alright...","text_story_52018":"(Mumbling softly) I only used a little magic; what's the big deal...","text_story_52019":"I heard that.","text_story_52020":"If you always train thinking you can just get by with the bare minimum, you may end up getting yourself killed in a real battle.","text_story_52021":"Believe me when I say that these lessons require blood, sweat, and tears. This is for your own good.","text_story_52022":"(Merida pouts for a long time before finally nodding her head.)","text_story_52023":"Right, continue then.","text_story_52024":"(Merida shrugs her aching shoulders as she prepares to fire another arrow.)","text_story_52025":"(This time, without any trickery, she manages to land her arrow firmly on the bullseye.)","text_story_52026":"Yeah! I've finally hit the target!","text_story_52027":"Not bad... This is a great start.","text_story_52028":"(A rare smile of approval spreads across Diana's face.)","text_story_52029":"Score another five hundred bullseyes and we can end today's training.","text_story_52030":"Five hundred?! You can't be serious!","text_story_52031":"I may just die of fatigue today in this blasted place...","text_story_52032":"(Merida's face instantly droops like a deflated balloon.)","text_story_52033":"(Seeing that you are standing to one side and observing her, Merida looks as though she has just found her saving grace. She shouts toward you...)","text_story_52034":"Save me! Save me, please!","text_story_52035":"(Looks over at you) Oh, you're here too.","text_story_52036":"Perfect timing; oversee Merida's training with me.","text_story_52037":"No...","text_story_52038":"Say something on my behalf, please!","text_story_52039":"(Merida looks at you helplessly.)","text_story_52040":"Surely it's enough for her to just be adept at magic?","text_story_52041":"Magic is not omnipotent.","text_story_52042":"I know of at least twenty ways to temporarily nullify magic.","text_story_52043":"When that happens, she's as helpless as a lamb caught in the jaws of a wolf.","text_story_52044":"What I'm doing now is strengthening her hooves such that in the event that her horns fall off, she is still able to shatter the wolf's fangs with a single kick.","text_story_52045":"Each additional combat skill that she is able to learn and master improves her chances of victory in battle.","text_story_52046":"Merida, do not see this as me being too harsh on you. There's a human idiom that goes—no pain, no gain.","text_story_52047":"You'll be thankful that this happened the next time you encounter actual danger.","text_story_52048":"Merida is but a child...","text_story_52049":"......","text_story_52050":"Do you... really not know?","text_story_52051":"Perhaps she really is a child, from the perspective of an Elf.","text_story_52052":"However, if we calculate her age from the perspective of a human, she is over a hundred years old.","text_story_52053":"Before today, she had wasted her time on frivolous fun.","text_story_52054":"It's time for her to train. If she encounters any danger in the future, I won't always be there to protect her.","text_story_52055":"All right...","text_story_52056":"Her logic is sound","text_story_52057":"There's no way for you to rebut her argument","text_story_52058":"(Turns toward Merida)","text_story_52059":"(Turns toward Merida) Listen to her. She's doing this for your good...","text_story_52060":"Hey, Merida, I'm talking to you! Are you even listening?","text_story_52061":"(You realize that the Merida beside you is looking a little sluggish. She does not react even when you wave your hands in front of her face.)","text_story_52062":"(Then, you nudge Merida's arm. Her body transforms into countless leaves that scatter at your touch.)","text_story_520621":"Merida! Where did you run off to?!","text_story_52063":"Don't bother with that, look over there.","text_story_52064":"(Diana lifts a finger and points into the distance. Upon looking in the indicated direction, you finally spot Merida.)","text_story_52065":"(It turns out that while Diana and you were talking, Merida had already planned to sneak away. At this moment, she has already run to the entrance of the training grounds.)","text_story_52066":"Merida! Hey, don't go!","text_story_52067":"!!","text_story_52068":"(Merida does not stop upon hearing your voice. Instead, she runs even faster.)","text_story_52069":"I'm... finally... free!","text_story_52070":"Ahhhhh!","text_story_52071":"(Right as Merida is cheering excitedly, a large net suddenly falls from the sky, wrapping around Merida tightly.)","text_story_52072":"(Seemingly unfazed, Diana's expression remains unchanged.)","text_story_52073":"I already knew that you would do such a thing, you little scamp. That's why I prepared a trap beforehand.","text_story_52074":"There's no use struggling—I have scattered anti-magic powder all across the net; your magic is of no use.","text_story_52075":"......","text_story_52076":"Diana! My dear sister! I've learned my lesson... Please let me out! I beg of you!","text_story_52077":"(Merida gives her a pitiful look.)","text_story_52078":"Sure.","text_story_52079":"I'll let you go if you complete double the training today—one thousand arrows.","text_story_52080":"......","text_story_52081":"(Stifling laughter)","text_story_520811":"One thousand!!!","text_story_52082":"I take back what I just said...","text_story_52083":"It's no longer a probability... I will die of fatigue today in this blasted place! With absolute certainty!","text_story_32001":"What a coincidence, I was also looking for you!","text_story_32002":"Is anything the matter?","text_story_32003":"Let's go and have a drink. My treat!","text_story_32004":"Did you do something wrong?","text_story_32005":"You're asking for my help?","text_story_32006":"No, of course not.","text_story_32007":"Come on, don't dilly-dally.","text_story_32008":"(Eluller pushes you toward a tavern.)","text_story_32009":"(The both of you sit down inside the tavern.)","text_story_32010":"(Eluller orders so much wine the table groans under its weight.)","text_story_32011":"We'll drink every last drop.","text_story_32012":"Don't you think you ordered... a bit too much?","text_story_32013":"Perhaps, but who's counting?","text_story_32014":"Cheers!","text_story_32015":"(And so, you and Eluller spend the night drinking to your hearts' content.)","text_story_32016":"(The next day——)","text_story_32017":"Uhmmm...","text_story_32018":"My head hurts...","text_story_32019":"I drank too much last night...","text_story_32020":"(You strive to open your eyes, but find yourself lying in a foreign room.)","text_story_32021":"This is...?","text_story_32022":"Try your best to recall","text_story_32023":"(You shake your head, trying to get rid of the feeling of dizziness brought about by the hangover. Then, you try to recall the events of yesterday.)","text_story_32024":"(Unfortunately, apart from your booze-drinking contest with Eluller, which you vividly remember, nothing else comes to mind.)","text_story_32025":"Eluller really has a great tolerance for alcohol...","text_story_32026":"Speaking of which, where is Eluller?","text_story_32027":"(You rise from the bed.)","text_story_32028":"(As you are about to leave the room in search for Eluller, you suddenly hear knocking coming from outside the door...)","text_story_32029":"Thud, thud, thud. Thud, thud, thud.","text_story_32030":"Come in?","text_story_32031":"(The door slowly opens and two ladies walk in through the door.)","text_story_32033":"You're awake earlier than I expected.","text_story_32034":"Why are the both of you here? Wait... Where am I?","text_story_32035":"You're in my house—Lytanis Manor.","text_story_32036":"You drank a lot, so I decided to let you spend the night at my place.","text_story_32037":"(Eluller smiles as she explains.)","text_story_32038":"Your alcohol tolerance is pretty decent after all.","text_story_32039":"(You notice that as Eluller speaks, she gives you a meaningful glance discretely.)","text_story_32040":"(You do not quite understand the meaning behind Eluller's glance.)","text_story_32041":"(However, the events that happen next would rapidly make its meaning clear.)","text_story_32042":"Apologies for disturbing your rest.","text_story_32043":"However, given that this is a rare opportunity, I must confirm something with you.","text_story_32044":"What do you need to confirm?","text_story_32045":"What happened between Eluller and you.","text_story_32046":"What???","text_story_32047":"(At this moment, Eluller, who is standing to one side, suddenly shoots another meaningful glance at you.)","text_story_32048":"(Then, she places a finger on her lips and motions for you to stay silent.)","text_story_32049":"???","text_story_32050":"As Eluller's sister, I have a duty to ensure her future happiness.","text_story_32051":"That's... great.","text_story_32052":"To be honest, you are not my candidate of choice.","text_story_32053":"I originally favored Lord Björn of the North.","text_story_32054":"He is young, capable, and of similar status as Eluller.","text_story_32055":"Given that Eluller had also resided in the North for quite some time, she would also be sufficiently acquainted with Björn.","text_story_32056":"......","text_story_32057":"(You awkwardly glance at Eluller.)","text_story_32058":"Athena, I've told you a million times before that Björn is my mentor and I respect him immensely. However, I do not love him.","text_story_32059":"I know what you're thinking... Eluller.","text_story_32060":"After all, Björn is just the person I'm happy with. If you have someone you like, you have my support.","text_story_32061":"The last thing I want to see is you being deprived of the right and freedom to pursue your own happiness, like other girls in the family.","text_story_32062":"(Athena turns toward you.)","text_story_32063":"Treat my sister well.","text_story_32064":"......","text_story_32065":"......","text_story_32066":"(Having said that, Athena turns to leave.)","text_story_32067":"(Only Eluller and you are left in the room.)","text_story_32068":"(A feeling of awkwardness hangs in the air.)","text_story_32069":"Mm, you performed well...","text_story_32070":"......","text_story_32071":"Shouldn't you explain yourself?","text_story_32072":"Well, it's not a big deal...","text_story_32073":"It's just... Athena feels that I'm old enough to start thinking about marriage.","text_story_32074":"That's why she keeps mentioning it to me.","text_story_32075":"I found this irritating, so I told her that...","text_story_32076":"You told her you liked me?","text_story_32077":"Yes, exactly.","text_story_32078":"Did she believe that?","text_story_32079":"She did not suspect anything?","text_story_32080":"She was not against it?","text_story_32081":"It's not that simple. My sister is no fool.","text_story_32082":"Thus, I had to show her a marriage certificate as proof of my marriage in the North. Your signature and mine are both on the certificate.","text_story_32083":"Naturally, it's not real. In any case, she's never seen what the real one looks like before.","text_story_32084":"???","text_story_32085":"But how did my name end up on it?","text_story_32086":"(You recall Eluller's suspicious behavior yesterday...)","text_story_32087":"!!!","text_story_32088":"So you purposely got me drunk yesterday and hoodwinked me to sign the certificate while I was inebriated?","text_story_32089":"Don't take this so seriously. Treat it as doing a friend a favor.","text_story_32090":"Also, yesterday's tab is on you.","text_story_32091":"(Eluller pats your shoulder.)","text_story_32092":"……Why do I remember you saying that you were giving me a treat?","text_story_32093":"Well, come on, never mind the little things.","text_story_32094":"So, we have to pretend to be a couple moving forward?","text_story_32095":"(She shrugs.) At least in front of Athena, that is.","text_story_32096":"How long do you intend to pretend for?","text_story_32097":"Athena will find out the truth eventually.","text_story_32098":"(Waves impatiently) Let's talk about this later.","text_story_32099":"Once I've figured out what kind of happiness I'm pursuing, I'll tell her the truth.","text_story_32100":"Right, this issue is temporarily resolved.","text_story_32101":"I think it's time for a celebration.","text_story_32102":"How about a few more drinks? Let's go!","text_story_32103":"......","text_story_61001":"(Night falls.

I guess I can't really say no.","text_story_11016":"(You walk three blocks with Lachesis, and are almost out of the city.)","text_story_11017":"We have arrived.","text_story_11018":"What is this place?","text_story_11019":"This is the city orphanage, home to more than thirty children.","text_story_11020":"Is this your job?","text_story_11021":"No, the orphanage is managed by the church in name, but the nuns have no obligation in this regard.","text_story_11022":"I came to see the children of my own volition.","text_story_11023":"You must be very popular with children, Lachesis.","text_story_11024":"I like children, too.","text_story_11025":"There are many boys in the orphanage. They adore the knights and heroes in those old stories.","text_story_11026":"Since you are here today, you can teach them about swordsmanship.","text_story_11027":"So, that's it... I'll do my best.","text_story_11028":"Be careful not to hurt them.","text_story_11029":"Don't worry, I will exercise restraint. Let's go in.","text_story_11030":"Sister Lachesis! Here comes Sister Lachesis!","text_story_11031":"What tasty food did you bring us this time, Sister Lachesis!","text_story_11032":"You brought a man this time!","text_story_11033":"(The children surround you.)","text_story_11034":"Are you Sister Lachesis's boyfriend?","text_story_11035":"Erm... Nope.","text_story_11036":"Do you like Sister Lachesis?","text_story_11037":"What are these children asking!?","text_story_11038":"It's okay, Lachesis. They're only children.","text_story_11039":"Is our relationship that obvious?","text_story_11040":"Hey, didn't I say? I knew it!","text_story_11041":"Don't get angry, they're just joking around. The children will forget all about it in a moment.","text_story_11042":"Alright, that's enough of that.","text_story_11043":"I brought you some pies. Eat them while they're still hot.","text_story_11044":"Sister Lachesis, are you trying to change the subject?","text_story_11045":"(The children grab the pies and then run off in all directions.)","text_story_11046":"(Only Lachesis and I remain.)","text_story_11047":"This is the most troublesome thing about children—they are so quick to make assumptions about all they encounter in the world.","text_story_11048":"There's nothing wrong with that. This is how children should be—fueled by their imagination.","text_story_11049":"Well, I'm used to their vivid imaginations.","text_story_11050":"Have you ever brought anyone here before, Lachesis?","text_story_11051":"Of course, I have brought other nuns with me, but you are the first man.","text_story_11052":"It's a great honor. Thank you for inviting me here. I will make sure I get along with them.","text_story_11053":"Whenever I am with them, I feel the wonder of life at its very genesis... yet, I feel as though we are all old friends.","text_story_11054":"So, is that why you work in the church still, observing human beings?","text_story_11055":"I used to be a nun... when I was human, I mean.","text_story_11056":"My work now is a way for me to revisit those days.","text_story_11057":"So, you were not born a Divine, Lachesis? I hadn't realized...","text_story_11058":"Over the long years, I have assumed many identities and experienced many things. Nothing has made me feel as at ease as my time here.","text_story_11059":"Maybe I will adopt a new identity a few years from now. That of a mother, for example...","text_story_11060":"That's a good choice... Hang on, what did you say?","text_story_11061":"You heard me.","text_story_11062":"Do you wish to be a mother, Lachesis? I can see that you really like children.","text_story_11063":"I never had a mother, so I really want to know what it feels like to be one myself.","text_story_11064":"But I do not have a human body, so this dream may never come true.","text_story_11065":"(Lachesis's eyes seem a little lonely.)","text_story_11066":"There must be a way!","text_story_11067":"(Lachesis laughs.)","text_story_11068":"(The whole hall becomes as soothing as the flowing spring breeze, decorated with beautiful blossoming flowers.)","text_story_11069":"What do you have in mind?","text_story_11070":"Not at this very moment...","text_story_11071":"Gentlemen should not make empty promises...","text_story_11072":"(At this time, the children finish their food and rush over.)","text_story_11073":"Those pies were delicious, Sister Lachesis!","text_story_11074":"This guy needs to play with us, since it's his first time here!","text_story_11075":"I'm here to teach you swordsmanship.","text_story_11076":"Yes, my friend here is a legendary warrior. He's very strong.","text_story_11077":"Didn't you say you wanted to learn swordsmanship? He can teach you.","text_story_11078":"Let me talk to Lachesis for a moment...","text_story_11079":"It's okay, you go ahead and spend some time with the children.","text_story_11080":"You did promise me, after all.","text_story_11081":"(The children drag me away.)","text_story_11082":"(I didn't even hear Lachesis's last words.)","text_story_11083":"If it's you, perhaps...","text_story_21001":"(Bang! Bang!...)","text_story_21002":"(When passing the Magic Academy, a strange explosion sounds from the grounds, and the whole area rumbles with violent tremors.)","text_story_21003":"(Remembering that Dorabella's magic workshop is there, you wonder what mischief the Ethereal Valkyrie has gotten up to this time.)","text_story_21004":"(Bang!... Bang!... Bang! Bang! Bang!)","text_story_21005":"(As you walk along a path paved with stone bricks, you come to the magic workshop, and the vibrations become stronger and stronger.)","text_story_21006":"(Suddenly, a strange scream comes from the workshop, and you hear Dorabella begin complaining loudly.)","text_story_21007":"Quiet! If you scream again, I'll turn you into shark bait!","text_story_21008":"(Finally, you can no longer hold back your curiosity. You decide to...)","text_story_21009":"Enter the workshop and see what Dorabella is doing...","text_story_21010":"Enter the workshop and stop Dorabella from causing mayhem...","text_story_21011":"(In the workshop, Dorabella stands over a table covered with alchemical parchments, playing with the colorful magic potions placed on it.)","text_story_21012":"(At one corner of the table, an angry little animal is locked in an iron cage, staring at Dorabella...)","text_story_21013":"(The situation is as chaotic as you expected, and your doubts multiply...)","text_story_21014":"A guest! What a rare delight! Are you here to see me?","text_story_21015":"I just came to see what you were doing...","text_story_21016":"I came to stop you from tearing down the building!","text_story_21017":"Oh? What a kind gesture... But as you can see, all I'm doing is making potions.","text_story_21018":"I need to channel my most genius sparks of inspiration into my experiments... Of course, there will inevitably be some \"minor accidents\" during the spellcasting process.","text_story_21019":"You must remember that I promised to help the Woodland Twins to cure that corruptive aura in the forest.","text_story_21020":"(You remember what happened in the woodland. You became involved in a foul scheme against the Woodland, Dorabella, and the two Woodland Twins.)","text_story_21021":"(After the crisis ended, Dorabella became a Valkyrie and promised to make magical medicine for the Woodland Twins, to neutralize the corruptive aura forever.)","text_story_21022":"(Dorabella's enthusiasm for helping others is still strong.)","text_story_21023":"(But her character is diametrically opposed to that of the twins, and it is difficult for you to imagine why they have such a good relationship.)","text_story_21024":"How do you know the Woodland Twins?","text_story_21025":"It all happened such a long time ago... What? Are you interested in my past?","text_story_21026":"(She puts down the potion in her hand and gives you a charming smile that seems to imply she has been waiting for your questions.)","text_story_21027":"......","text_story_21028":"Of course!","text_story_21029":"Hmm... I had just become a mage apprentice at that time.","text_story_21030":"In order to \"help\" me control the powerful magic I was born with, my parents left me in the hands of the Mage Council.","text_story_21031":"However, I could never bear to listen to the boring teachings of those old mages.","text_story_21032":"Whenever the opportunity presented itself, I would leave the Council and travel to all parts of the continent to discover things that really interested me.","text_story_21033":"While passing a small town on the edge of the Empire, I heard an interesting story.","text_story_21034":"Hunters operating in the jungle had been disappearing one after another, and were found lying on the edge of the woods a few days later.","text_story_21035":"They were not harmed, but they had lost their memory about the jungle.","text_story_21036":"This jungle...","text_story_21037":"...It wasn't Foggy Jungle, was it?","text_story_21038":"That's right. The villagers all said that ghosts haunted the jungle.","text_story_21039":"However, I doubted the Eclipse would do something so quaint.","text_story_21040":"When I entered the jungle, I found that the fog was mixed with toxic substances.","text_story_21041":"Then I met the two Woodland Twins.","text_story_21042":"Obviously, I thought they were the perpetrators of this mess.","text_story_21043":"...I must say that the atmosphere was a little tense, but I soon understood that the Woodland Twins were not to blame.","text_story_21044":"(After listening to Dorabella's story, you can quickly guess the intentions of the Woodland Twins.)","text_story_21045":"(The two gentle sisters would never do anything so awful...)","text_story_21046":"The Woodland Twins saved those hunters.","text_story_21047":"The Woodland Twins just wanted to give the hunters a warning.","text_story_21048":"Exactly. Foggy Jungle was being polluted by a corruptive aura. They had to keep all life away from the jungle.","text_story_21049":"I realized how serious the consequences of this pollution would be, so I decided to help the two gentle sisters.","text_story_21050":"I followed them to the center of Foggy Jungle.","text_story_21051":"There was a deep crack, from which the corruptive aura emanated.","text_story_21052":"At that time, there was a sudden explosion, and a huge stream of corruptive aura gushed out.","text_story_21053":"The lush jungle instantly turned into a decayed, dead wasteland.","text_story_21054":"It sounds like a terrible situation...","text_story_21055":"What happened to you after that?","text_story_21056":"In a moment of crisis, I unleashed a powerful spell that I had not yet fully mastered.","text_story_21057":"Arcane energy completely crushed the surrounding terrain.","text_story_21058":"The rift spreading the corruptive aura was buried in the rubble, and the crisis was temporarily averted.","text_story_21059":"After that, I promised to make magical potions for the Woodland Twins to cure the corruptive aura.","text_story_21060":"(After telling her story, she beams at you with a proud look.)","text_story_21061":"Well, I really accomplished something, don't you think?","text_story_21062":"I suppose...","text_story_21063":"I appreciate your heroism.","text_story_21064":"Unfortunately, the High Mages of the Citadel don't agree with you.","text_story_21065":"They thought that what I did was an offence to the Woodland forces and caused them unnecessary trouble.","text_story_21066":"They even tried me in court.","text_story_21067":"(When Dorabella mentioned the Citadel, the small animal in the iron cage screamed, as if expressing its contempt.)","text_story_21068":"Oh? It seems someone's dying to go swimming in the sea!","text_story_21069":"I've been meaning to ask...","text_story_21070":"What is this thing?","text_story_21071":"This is a groundhog—a disgusting animal.","text_story_21072":"(As she speaks, Dorabella picks up her staff and pokes the poor little creature with its tip.)","text_story_21073":"I know this species...","text_story_21074":"What are you doing with this little thing?","text_story_21075":"You're like a detective, aren't you? Well, it seems this story is not over yet.","text_story_21076":"At the Citadel's trial, my mentor Liddell defended me... He saved me from being punished by the Council.","text_story_21077":"But the price I had to pay was that I was forced to wear a pair of magic bracelets Liddell had made for me.","text_story_21078":"He said that these bracelets would help me control my magic.","text_story_21079":"After putting on the bracelets, my magic was suppressed, while my mentor's magic increased day by day.","text_story_21080":"Soon, he became a high-profile mage of the Mage Council.","text_story_21081":"Smart as you are, you should be able to guess what Liddell did to me.","text_story_21082":"Liddell stole your magic through the bracelets.","text_story_21083":"Your mentor is truly despicable.","text_story_21084":"Hmph... Too true.","text_story_21085":"At that time, the position of the Ethereal Valkyrie had just become vacant, and the Citadel selected Liddell to inherit the title.","text_story_21086":"Upon taking up his new role, Liddell would not only have been in charge of the Mage Council, along with the High Mages...","text_story_21087":"...He would also receive an ancient staff named Lirayesh..","text_story_21088":"Undoubtedly, what Liddell did was a serious betrayal of my trust, and it infuriated me beyond belief.","text_story_21089":"So, on the day of the ascension ceremony, I opened the doors of the mage temple with my magic.","text_story_21090":"With the eyes of all present locked on me, I teleported to Lirayesh and picked up the arcane staff.","text_story_21091":"An unprecedented surge of magic filled my body.","text_story_21092":"This powerful force helped me to break free from the shackles of the magic bracelets.","text_story_21093":"Before I left, I cast a \"small spell\" on my dear teacher to teach him a lesson.","text_story_21094":"You mean to say...","text_story_21095":"...This poor groundhog is your teacher!?","text_story_21096":"(Dorabella doesn't deny your statement. She just looks at the groundhog in the cage with contempt and laughs.)","text_story_21097":"What did you do after that?","text_story_21098":"I don't think the Citadel could have been very happy with you...","text_story_21099":"Indeed. The Citadel was very angry.","text_story_21100":"They announced my permanent banishment.","text_story_21101":"So, in the end, I got the freedom to travel around the continent I always wanted.","text_story_21102":"But when the Demons invaded the royal city, I knew that I had to do something.","text_story_21103":"On the invitation of General Athena, I returned to the Empire to fight against the Demons with the mages.","text_story_21104":"At present, the Mage Council has suffered serious losses, so I promised to help them rebuild their organization.","text_story_21105":"The Citadel finally accepted me as their new Ethereal Valkyrie.","text_story_21106":"Hah... This world really can change in an instant.","text_story_21107":"You're right, especially when it comes to what happened when we met...","text_story_21108":"The biggest surprise of my life was signing a contract with you to become a Valkyrie...","text_story_21109":"Considering all the questionable deeds I've committed, I never thought the Creator would bless me so.","text_story_21110":"You deserve to be a Valkyrie, Dorabella.","text_story_21111":"You have not failed to live up to the name Valkyrie, Dorabella.","text_story_21112":"(Dorabella can't help but laugh with joy when you try to reassure her.)","text_story_21113":"Thank you... At least, there are no lies hidden among your clumsy words...","text_story_21114":"Hmm... Well, let me give you this precious potion—you deserve it.","text_story_21115":"(She rummages through the various potions on the table, then finally picks up a delicate glass bottle and gives it to you.)","text_story_21116":"(You carefully inspect the glass bottle, which contains a small amount of light pink liquid.)","text_story_21117":"This tonic will bring you extraordinary good luck.","text_story_21118":"You can drink it whenever you're in a spot of bad luck.","text_story_21119":"I accept your gift and thank you.","text_story_21120":"(After receiving the gift, you leave Dorabella's magic workshop.)","text_story_21121":"(After doing so, you finally remember the purpose of your visit...)","text_story_21122":"(However, you decide to accommodate the casual Ethereal Valkyrie this time and let her enjoy her freedom...)","text_story_71001":"Well, according to the map, we have successfully reached our destination!","text_story_71002":"(After two days at sea, you follow Catrina to a desert island.)","text_story_71003":"We conquered violent storms and tempestuous waves to get here. What a pleasant voyage.","text_story_71004":"(Recalling the storm you experienced on the way here, you immediately feel unwell...)","text_story_71005":"At one point, the ship flew more than ten meters into the air...","text_story_71006":"I thought we were going to be swallowed by the sea...","text_story_71007":"Don't worry, it was nothing.","text_story_71008":"I remember one time Captain Samuel led us over waves thirty meters high!","text_story_71009":"(Looking back at the ragged coastline, it seems most shipwrecks don't even make it to the shore...)","text_story_71010":"It appears many people have died here...","text_story_71011":"Are you sure there will be treasure here?","text_story_71012":"Of course. I cleaned out all the pirates in the tavern to get the last piece of the treasure map.","text_story_71013":"As the captain of the Redsail Pirates, when I pick up a scent for treasure, it's never wrong.","text_story_71014":"(Catrina is determined. For this treasure hunt, she claims that she will temporarily pick up her once discarded title as a pirate.)","text_story_71015":"(She even raised the white sails used by pirate ships...)","text_story_71016":"You call yourselves the Redsail Pirates, yet you fly white sails.","text_story_71017":"Is there any special reason behind this?","text_story_71018":"This name was chosen by our former leader, Captain Samuel.","text_story_71019":"They say the name originated from a fierce battle and implies a warning to our enemies.","text_story_71020":"But right now, we need to focus on finding the treasure on this island.","text_story_71021":"(You look at the slightly worn treasure map in Catrina's hand.)","text_story_71022":"(In the drawing, the symbol marked as treasure is displayed right in the middle of the island.)","text_story_71023":"(The map is easy to understand. Except for a few forked paths, the road to the treasure looks very smooth.)","text_story_71024":"(The only problem is the black fog surrounding the island...)","text_story_71025":"The location of the treasure seems a little too obvious for a treasure map...","text_story_71026":"I can't see any other dangers around, except for the black fog.","text_story_71027":"This treasure doesn't need any traps to stop people, because it is a trap in itself.","text_story_71028":"The treasure hidden on this island is called the \"Black Diamond\", a legendary cursed diamond.","text_story_71029":"The Black Diamond has always been a forbidden treasure for pirates.","text_story_71030":"Many people have reached this island famed for its precious stones, but none have managed to seize the diamond and leave here alive...","text_story_71031":"According to the records left by Captain Samuel, the black mist on the island is caused by the \"Curse of the Black Diamond\".","text_story_71032":"It is also the reason why no one can leave here alive.","text_story_71033":"Well, chin up! It's time to go into the black mist and find out for ourselves!","text_story_71034":"I wonder if the curse is as terrible as the rumors say.","text_story_71035":"(Catrina pulls you into the mist without saying a word...)","text_story_71036":"(As you approach the center of the island, the black mist becomes thicker and your vision is gradually obscured completely...)","text_story_71037":"Look, I can see light up ahead! I think I found the way out...","text_story_71038":"(Catrina's fading voice fills your ear.)","text_story_71039":"(Suddenly, the fog fades, and you find yourself on the deck of a warship in a trance...)","text_story_71040":"This is...","text_story_71041":"The black mist casts illusions.","text_story_71042":"Admiral Herschel, on the command of Captain Samuel, I have come seeking a truce.","text_story_71043":"Eclipse warships are attacking the Empire's merchant ships.","text_story_71044":"For the safety of the civilians, Captain Samuel believes that we should temporarily join forces to fight against this common enemy.","text_story_71045":"A truce? Hmph, the Empire doesn't negotiate with pirates, especially not Samuel's pirates.","text_story_71046":"But I cannot ignore the safety of the people—at least they pay sufficient taxes to me... I mean the Empire...","text_story_71047":"...Very well, you can go back and tell Samuel that I will temporarily stop persecuting you pirates.","text_story_71048":"But when it comes to the battle between the pirates and the Eclipse, the Empire will not lend a hand to either party.","text_story_71049":"Captain Samuel expected you to say that... We agree with your terms.","text_story_71050":"By the way, after rescuing the merchant ship, you should give me half of its cargo as a tribute.","text_story_71051":"This kind of dirty work should be a perfect match for you filthy pirates.","text_story_71052":"......","text_story_71053":"(The image spins before you, and you are returned to the island, Catrina standing by your side...)","text_story_71054":"The illusion in the black mist...","text_story_71055":"Was that your memory?","text_story_71056":"That was the last battle I fought with Captain Samuel. It was also a memory I tried to forget...","text_story_71057":"At that time, we were about to escape the pursuit of the Empire's warships, but we happened to encounter the Eclipse plundering innocent merchant ships.","text_story_71058":"In order to rescue the merchant ship, Captain Samuel ordered me to sign a truce agreement with the shameless Admiral Herschel...","text_story_71059":"It seems that the black mist's so-called curse is actually just these painful memories.","text_story_71060":"(You are close to the center of the island.)","text_story_71061":"(Not far away, on an altar-like platform, the thick black mist flows eerily from the Black Diamond.)","text_story_71062":"(The ground surrounding the Black Diamond is heaped with skeletons...)","text_story_71063":"Most people fail to escape the prison of their own memories.","text_story_71064":"I will not be defeated by the dead of the past. This diamond will be mine!","text_story_71065":"(Catrina goes to the altar and reaches for the diamond enshrined on the tall platform.)","text_story_71066":"(The moment she touches the Black Diamond, the black mist's illusion envelops you once again.)","text_story_71067":"(This time, you see Catrina standing on the deck of a ship consumed by flames.)","text_story_71068":"(She is confronted by Admiral Herschel from the previous illusion.)","text_story_71069":"(Her left eye has been cut by a sharp blade and is bleeding...)","text_story_71070":"Captain Samuel was seriously injured saving the merchant ships... but in the end, you killed him...","text_story_71071":"Herschel! You treacherous dog! You will pay for your betrayal!","text_story_71072":"Stupid girl! Did you really think I would stand by that ridiculous agreement and let Samuel go?","text_story_71073":"What can I say...? I've grown tired of playing cat and mouse with the Redsail Pirates all these years.","text_story_71074":"Samuel is dead! My war with the pirates ends today!","text_story_71075":"No matter how many lives are lost! Even if the sea is dyed red with blood!","text_story_71076":"After the Empire crushes you, all the wealth you've accumulated will belong to me!","text_story_71077":"Scum! Captain Samuel's spirit will never die!","text_story_71078":"I will use his spear to avenge him!","text_story_71079":"(Catrina raises the bloody spear in her hand. A fated battle is imminent...)","text_story_71080":"(The sounds of gunfire fill your ears, then the strong smell of gunpowder diffuses through the air.)","text_story_71081":"(Amidst the clashing of blades, the black mist's illusion begins to blur, and then brings you to the end of the battle...)","text_story_71082":"(Catrina strikes down the saber in Herschel's hand with her spear, gaining the upper hand.)","text_story_71083":"(She threatens her foe with the spear, forcing him to the edge of the deck...)","text_story_71084":"This battle... is mine.","text_story_71085":"You... You can't kill me...","text_story_71086":"Let me go... I'll give you the freedom to plunder ships unharried... We will rule this sea together and divvy up the spoils...","text_story_71087":"It's too late to beg for mercy. The white sails have been stained red...","text_story_71088":"I will use your life to sate the dead souls resting eternally beneath these waves...","text_story_71089":"(The gun is fired, and a bullet penetrates the heart of the betrayer.)","text_story_71090":"(Herschel's stiff body falls into the sea and is immediately swallowed by the bloody waves...)","text_story_71091":"(The burning flames light up the blood red sea, making it seem as though the sea itself is on fire.)","text_story_71092":"(The white sails are stained red under the light of the flames and the bloody sea...)","text_story_71093":"(You remember Catrina once said that the name of her pirate band signified a warning...)","text_story_71094":"After a fierce battle, fire and blood stain the white sails red...","text_story_71095":"So, that's why you're called the Redsail Pirates...","text_story_71096":"(The illusion gradually fades away like a flickering flame...

Sounds pleasant...","text_story_22071":"Baby, what honeyed words... Moonlight Dew is a type of love potion that I have specially concocted.","text_story_22072":"Such potions have intensely strong effects and will cause the user to become enamored with a female whom he glimpses underneath the moonlight.","text_story_22073":"In order to remove the effect of the potion, you must perform an \"intimate interaction\" with a Valkyrie.","text_story_22074":"After all, love is the best antidote.","text_story_22075":"In-intimate interaction?","text_story_22076":"As a Valkyrie, I will not condone of such filthy behavior in public...","text_story_22077":"You're such a spoilsport...

Our holy maiden has immediately become so \"immodest\" after the Creator fell into a deep slumber. How shocking...","text_story_22120":"I am only trying to heal the disease. My actions do not carry any personal desire...","text_story_22121":"As a fellow Valkyrie, I must expose your clumsy lie, Moira of Fate.","text_story_22122":"Due to the Moira of Fate's disrespect toward the Creator, I think I am forced to make another choice...","text_story_22123":"(As the atmosphere became increasingly strained, the three of them also start to argue more and more intensely...)","text_story_22124":"(You try to stop the impending catastrophe, but your wits are still deeply affected by the potion...)","text_story_22125":"Ladies, you need not argue because of me...","text_story_22126":"I can satisfy all three of you at the same time...","text_story_22127":"Alright, baby. I think that all of us are already aware of your true intentions... but our battle cannot end like this.","text_story_22128":"I have had enough of your constant meddling....","text_story_22129":"Come, darling. Follow me back to our love nest. This time, nobody will be able to stop us.","text_story_22130":"Your evil scheme won't succeed...","text_story_22131":"I must guide this salvation... even if I must resort to force...","text_story_22132":"(As a result of their opposing viewpoints, Aiushtha and Lachesis begin to cast offensive spells at one another...)","text_story_22133":"(Pink and golden magic begin to interweave into a vortex, with you at the center—the most dangerous area of all...)","text_story_22134":"(In the nick of time, a blue light flickers into existence. Dorabella appears by your side, reaching her hand out to you.)","text_story_22135":"Hold my hand, babe, and let us leave this place...","text_story_22136":"Hold her hand...","text_story_22137":"Hold her hand tightly...","text_story_22138":"(Dorabella soars into the sky with you, flying into the night, enveloped by shining silver moonlight...)","text_story_22139":"(You sit next to the Ethereal Valkyrie's staff as you lean against her voluptuous and supple body...)","text_story_22140":"(Under the serene moonlight, you are able to clearly see her beautiful countenance, her crimson lips, and her straight nose...)","text_story_22141":"(She has fine eyebrows that are as gentle as the crescent moon and pupils that are as clear as amethysts...)","text_story_22142":"(Her breathtaking eyes emanate intense desire as they slowly approach you...)","text_story_22143":"(You close your eyes...)","text_story_22144":"(Above your lips, a touch as gentle as chiffon and as sweet as honey lingers for just an instant before fading away...)","text_story_22145":"(Thereafter, someone whispers softly into your ear...)","text_story_22146":"And thus, the potion's effects will finally be lifted. Sweet dreams, baby...","text_story_13001":"(On this day, you passed through a small town with Eluller and Merida, you found that the residents here seem to be holding some kind of mourning ceremony...)","text_story_13002":"(looks around curiously) What are these people doing?","text_story_13003":"(Merida looks at you. You shake your head, indicating that you have no idea.)","text_story_13004":"I've heard of it.","text_story_13005":"It seems to be a religious tradition in this place. Every year around this time, they gather to commemorate a hero who saved them.","text_story_13006":"It is said that many years ago, the residents here were enslaved by an evil demon.","text_story_13007":"In order to defeat the demon that deprived them of their freedom, a nun bravely stood up, sealed the demon in her body with a trick, and then purified it with flames...","text_story_13008":"(Confused) What does \"purify\" mean? Is it a powerful magic? I also want to learn, so I don't have to be afraid of demons!","text_story_13009":"......","text_story_13010":"......","text_story_13011":"... Cough, the meaning of \"purify\", in layman's terms, is to use the stake to burn the nun and the demon to death together.","text_story_13012":"!!!","text_story_13013":"(Stunned) Ah! ? Wouldn't that be painful? Just thinking about it makes me feel unbearable pain...","text_story_13014":"Yes, but that nun did. She sacrificed herself to defeat the demon and regain freedom for the people. And people erected statues for her to commemorate her great deeds.","text_story_13015":"What a great one. Let's go pay a visit too, shall we?","text_story_13016":"OK, let's go.","text_story_13017":"(You follow the crowd to the statue of the nun.)","text_story_13018":"(You look at the statue with reverence.)","text_story_13019":"(It is a stone statue of a girl carved out of marble. The girl's hands are folded together, and she is bowing her head in prayer. Although the carving technique is not refined, it still allows people to feel the holiness of the girl just by looking at it.)","text_story_13020":"salute","text_story_13021":"(Together with Eluller and Merida, you imitate the postures of the others and bow to the statue.)","text_story_13022":"(After everyone saluted, several choir members went to the crowd and sang the hero's deeds to the people.)","text_story_13023":"(The melodious sound of praise passes your ears and drifts into the distance. The content of the story is not different from what Eluller told, but the details are more complete.)","text_story_13024":"(You are immersed in the story, unknowingly, time flies by, and the sun is about to set. The crowd is also slowly dispersing.)","text_story_13025":"It's almost time, let's go too.","text_story_13026":"Alright.","text_story_13027":"(You are about to leave. But when you turn around, you suddenly see a familiar figure from under the eaves in the distance.)","text_story_13028":"That is……?","text_story_13029":"What's wrong?","text_story_13030":"It's nothing, just wait for me first, I'll be back in a while.","text_story_13031":"(After saying hello to Eluller, you walk towards the figure you just saw.)","text_story_13032":"(What a coincidence! I didn't expect you to be here, Lacsis.)","text_story_13033":"(Lacsis nodded to you and then showed a shallow smile as a way to greet you)","text_story_13034":"Are you also here to attend the mourning ceremony? Why don't you get closer, but stand so far away?","text_story_13035":"I am, or I am not. You can think of me as visiting an... old friend.","text_story_13036":"(Lacsis looked at the statue in the distance, his expression suddenly becoming somewhat complex.)","text_story_13037":"You must have heard her story.","text_story_13038":"Yes.","text_story_13039":"Very nice story. A heroic nun who heroically sacrificed herself to die with the devil in order to free her people.","text_story_13040":"......","text_story_13041":"(Lacsis shook his head gently and then let out a very light laugh, but it sounded like a sigh again.)","text_story_13042":"I know another version of this story.","text_story_13043":"It's just that what I'm going to talk about may not be as \"nice\" as you hear.","text_story_13044":"listen carefully","text_story_13045":"(Lacsis did not speak immediately, as if organizing his thoughts. After a moment, she spoke slowly.)","text_story_13046":"According to the stories I know, the girl was not brave. She was so scared that she couldn't stop shaking...","text_story_13047":"She didn't volunteer to kill the demons...","text_story_13048":"…but were picked out by people who were also shrouded in fear as sacrifices to the devil.","text_story_13049":"That demon, raised by the girl's adoptive father, possessed the young people and sucked their life, and used it to prolong life and youth for itself.","text_story_13050":"As for how the story ends...","text_story_13051":"(Lacsis sigh.)","text_story_13052":"Although in terms of results, it is not much different from what you heard. But the girl was actually tied up by her compatriots and pushed to the stake...","text_story_13053":"!?","text_story_13054":"how could this be! ?","text_story_13055":"After hearing what I said, do you still think that this story is nice?","text_story_13056":"......","text_story_13057":"(As the two of you talked, the sun gradually faded, and darkness and silence slowly enveloped the place.)","text_story_13058":"Well, the ceremony is over, and it's time for us to say goodbye. May the Creator bless you.","text_story_13059":"Wait, I have one last question.","text_story_13060":"Please say.","text_story_13061":"The girl in the story...is that you?","text_story_13062":"(Lacsis's figure froze for a moment, and soon returned to its original state.)","text_story_13063":"Maybe, maybe not. What does it matter.","text_story_13064":"(The figure of Lacsis slowly disappeared into the night.)","text_story_13065":"(A sense of trance comes over you. You walk up to the statue again, and look carefully at the name engraved on the stone—)","text_story_13066":"(Although the name on the statue has become blurred under the erosion of wind and rain, you have a strong feeling that the name must be Lacsis.)","text_story_13067":"If your experience is really what you say, you should probably become a demon...","text_story_13068":"But now you are a divine. So, what have you been through, Lacsis?","text_story_13069":"(This problem is buried in your heart, it seems that you can only find another opportunity to chat with Lacsis.)","text_story_72001":"(Loud, filthy, and smoky... The chaotic environment muddles your hearing and vision...)","text_story_72002":"(Catrina drags you to a tavern in a secluded corner of Menerd Port.)","text_story_72003":"(Here, the patrons dress in navy uniforms, but they look as scruffy as pirates. Catrina greets them kindly.)","text_story_72004":"Captain! We've chased off the other pirates as instructed!","text_story_72005":"Now, this will be the Redsail Pirates' turf!","text_story_72006":"Fool! We're already soldiers of the Empire!","text_story_72007":"So what? I prefer to live as a pirate!","text_story_72008":"(The crew, who used to be pirates, begin arguing among themselves...)","text_story_72009":"Well done, you bastards. Now, quiet!","text_story_72010":"(As soon as Catrina barked her order, the prattling crewmen shut up at once.)","text_story_72011":"(Meanwhile, you are still very much confused...)","text_story_72012":"Why did you take me here?","text_story_72013":"What are you up to?","text_story_72014":"Don't you worry. I just want to give you a surprise.","text_story_72015":"(Catrina waves her hand, then two pirates carry a crate of red wine and place it on a table in the tavern...)","text_story_72016":"Listen here, boys. Like you, I miss my days as a pirate, unfettered and free.","text_story_72017":"But the current situation is tense. For the safety of Menerd Port and its people, we must fight alongside the Empire.","text_story_72018":"But today, we can put aside all this trouble.","text_story_72019":"I've got my hands on some great wine I want to share with you all.","text_story_72020":"This is a royal gift that you poor bastards would've never had a chance of drinking!","text_story_72021":"Don't waste it. Grab your cups and get over here! Let us drink to our heart's content!","text_story_72022":"Ohhhhhh! Thank you, Captain! Long live the Redsail Pirates!","text_story_72023":"(Catrina's words make the crew cheer with excitement...)","text_story_72024":"About the origin of the wine...","text_story_72025":"I have a suspicion...","text_story_72026":"Don't overthink, my dear. Enjoy the moment. It's the key to longevity.","text_story_72027":"(Catrina winks at you and shrugs off your concern.)","text_story_72028":"(Just as the pirates raise their glass in celebration, the door to the tavern suddenly opens, and General Athena walks in with some heavily-armored soldiers.)","text_story_72029":"(Interrupted by these intruders, the pirates who are about to enjoy their wine exchange glances, and silence descends upon the tavern.)","text_story_72030":"Found you, Catrina! Return the red wine you stole from the cargo hold immediately!","text_story_72031":"The red wine is tribute meant for the royal family. I must stop you before you commit a serious crime!","text_story_72032":"I knew it...","text_story_72033":"Those crates full of wine are stolen goods...","text_story_72034":"Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud, General Athena.","text_story_72035":"The cargo hold is full of wine. If you pretend nothing happened, no one will notice a thing.","text_story_72036":"Besides, the Omniguardian wants a taste of the precious royal tribute. Isn't that right, my dear?","text_story_72037":"(As the tension worsens, Catrina pulls you into the line of fire...)","text_story_72038":"Omniguardian... Please tell me what's really on your mind.","text_story_72039":"(Facing Athena's questioning, you suggest...)","text_story_72040":"Catrina should return the red wine.","text_story_72041":"We can enjoy the red wine together.","text_story_72042":"I know you will do the right thing.","text_story_72043":"Your betrayal is unexpected... but my crew and I won't give it up.","text_story_72044":"I knew you'd take my side, my dear.","text_story_72045":"...Unfortunately, in order to fulfill my duties, I cannot sit idly by, even if the Omniguardian approves of this.","text_story_72046":"As it seems, a fight is unavoidable.","text_story_72047":"Put down the wine bottles! You filthy scum!","text_story_72048":"Hah! I never liked these pretentious soldiers! Brothers, to arms!","text_story_72049":"(The heavily armored soldiers raise their spears. The scruffy pirates unsheathe the machetes attached to their waists...)","text_story_72050":"(Catrina lifts the gun in her hand and points it at the sword-wielding Athena.)","text_story_72051":"Hm... This reminds me of the game of catch we had played with the Empire.","text_story_72052":"That's right. It was when you were still a pirate wanted by the Empire.","text_story_72053":"But now that you've become the Sea Admiral of the Empire, I'm afraid your actions will be deemed an act of betrayal...)","text_story_72054":"Betrayal? How interesting...","text_story_72055":"I think we both know—between the Empire and the pirates—who the real traitor is.","text_story_72056":"......","text_story_72057":"(Hearing Catrina's words, Athena becomes hesitant.)","text_story_72058":"(To keep the situation under control, you must calm them down...)","text_story_72059":"Ladies, let's calm down, shall we?","text_story_72060":"There is another way to resolve this...","text_story_72061":"(Catrina takes heed and retracts her gun.)","text_story_72062":"(Athena, too, lowers her sword.)","text_story_72063":"Good, looks like we can reach a compromise.","text_story_72064":"This is a tavern in Menerd Port. When you're on pirate turf, you have to resolve conflicts the pirate way!","text_story_72065":"......","text_story_72066":"(Now, you, Catrina, and Athena sit at a table, on which two bottles of hard liquor are placed...)","text_story_72067":"We'll decide who gets their way through a drinking competition?","text_story_72068":"That's right! This is how pirates solve problems. The last one standing is the winner!","text_story_72069":"You'll be the judge of our contest!","text_story_72070":"(To resolve the conflict between them, you must choose a type of liquor...)","text_story_72071":"Rum.","text_story_72072":"Gin.","text_story_72073":"(You fill their cups. They pick up the drinks and down them immediately...)","text_story_72074":"(Catrina also enthusiastically pours you half a cup of rum. The strong yet sweet liquor burns your throat as you gulp it down.)","text_story_72075":"Ah! Rum, the pirates' booze...","text_story_72076":"Do you remember? I got you this drink on the boat when we first met.","text_story_72077":"I remember it. The pirates' drink was poorly made and bitter... But it was refreshing.","text_story_72078":"How did a pirate and a general become acquainted with each other?","text_story_72079":"You won't believe this. Athena was the one who came to the Redsail Pirates.","text_story_72080":"She then signed a secret pact with us...","text_story_72081":"As for what's in it... You may ask this straitlaced general.","text_story_72082":"... It was a \"Privateering License\" given to the pirates by the Empire.","text_story_72083":"At that time, the Empire had yet to unify the continent, so they decided to hire the pirates to do their dirty work.","text_story_72084":"Yes, the Empire promised not to hunt down the pirates and told us to rob the merchant ships and naval fleets of other countries...","text_story_72085":"But once the Empire unified the continent, the king went back on his promise and broke the pact.","text_story_72086":"The Redsail Pirates suffered heavy losses and had no choice but to return to the deep seas, roaming aimlessly.","text_story_72087":"This is the Empire's fault...","text_story_72088":"I understand the pirates' resentment toward the Empire...","text_story_72089":"Do you feel the same way?","text_story_72090":"I was only following orders, even though it wasn't just.","text_story_72091":"I apologize to you and the pirates, Catrina...","text_story_72092":"Hah, drop the formality. You're making me uncomfortable.","text_story_72093":"I much prefer the old you who could lose the high and mighty general act and mingle with us pirates.","text_story_72094":"Look, our cups are empty! Hurry up and fill them!","text_story_72095":"(To resolve the conflict between them, you must choose a type of liquor...)","text_story_72096":"Rum.","text_story_72097":"Gin.","text_story_72098":"(You fill their cups. They pick up the drinks and down them immediately...)","text_story_72099":"(Catrina also enthusiastically pours you half a cup of rum. The refreshing liquor goes down smoothly, leaving a rich taste in your mouth...)","text_story_72100":"Gin... I recall the Northern Duke commissioning some merchants to send a batch of gin as a tribute to the Empire.","text_story_72101":"As it was transported, the goods were taken by pirates. Fortunately, the merchants were safe and sound...","text_story_72102":"After this incident, Duke Björn was enraged. It's a shame that we haven't managed to find the culprit to this day...","text_story_72103":"Of course you haven't, it was my doing after all!","text_story_72104":"Apart from the liquor, there was a fine fur lying on my bed as we speak!","text_story_72105":"...Okay, I knew it had something to do with you.","text_story_72106":"But there's something I can't quite figure out. Why didn't the merchants recognize the emblem of the Redsail Pirates?","text_story_72107":"Oh, that's simple. It's because the merchants kept half of the goods to themselves.","text_story_72108":"Sharing is caring... This is why we Redsail Pirates are better liked than the Empire.","text_story_72109":"Also, I wanted to see the Northern Duke get absolutely pissed when things didn't go his way.","text_story_72110":"(As Catrina speaks, she can't help but smile...)","text_story_72111":"We better keep this a secret from Björn...","text_story_72112":"Humph, I must admit... it was a smart tactic, Catrina.","text_story_72113":"The cups are already empty. Hurry and begin the next round of drinks.","text_story_72114":"......","text_story_72115":"(Soon enough, the table is filled with empty bottles, and the two of them are dead drunk...)","text_story_72116":"After drinking heavily with the two ladies, you feel your head spinning, and your stomach is churning...)","text_story_72117":"*Belch* I saw three Athena collapsing in front of me... I won... thrice!","text_story_72118":"No, you lose. Catrina... I'm still sober... I can drink over three times more than you...","text_story_72119":"(Even though you can barely think straight, you still try to be the peacemaker...)","text_story_72120":"I think it's a draw...","text_story_72121":"Why don't you meet each other halfway...","text_story_72122":"And finish half the red wine...","text_story_72123":"Hahahaha——You heard that, Athena? I agree with the Omniguardian's suggestion... *Belch*","text_story_72124":"What are you yapping about? Might as well drink to our hearts' content... Open the entire crate—","text_story_72125":"General... Athena?","text_story_72126":"Great, we've been wanting to drink it this whole time!","text_story_72127":"(Hearing what Athena said, the soldiers are flabbergasted. The pirates, on the other hand, are ecstatic.)","text_story_72128":"Heard the general's order? Don't just stand there. Fill the cups. Let's drink as much as we want!","text_story_72129":"(In the loud, filthy, and smoky tavern... pirates and soldiers alike raise their cups and drink together...)","text_story_72130":"(The pirates lead the soldiers in singing the shanties they used to sing on their voyages...)","text_story_72131":"(They relive the carefree joy of the past as if it will continue forever...)","text_treat_53001":"(During the battle in the Woodland, Diana is struck by Percival's potion.)","text_treat_53002":"(The potion spills out, but, surprisingly, Diana does not suffer serious injury.)","text_treat_53003":"(How fortunate...)","text_treat_53004":"(In pain) Ugh... Ahh...","text_treat_53005":"Diana?! Are you all right? What happened?","text_treat_53006":"(Weakly) It's n-nothing...","text_treat_53007":"You don't sound too good. Do you need my help?","text_treat_53008":"(Panting) No! Don't come in... I don't want to be seen in this sorry state!","text_treat_53009":"All right then, I respect your will.","text_treat_53010":"Diana, you need help!","text_treat_53011":"(\"Thump!\" It sounds as if things are bumping against each other in the room.)","text_treat_53012":"(You can't help but open the door to the room.)","text_treat_53013":"(Diana has collapsed on her bed.)","text_treat_53014":"Diana! What's going on with you?!","text_treat_53015":"(Feebly) I-I'm fine... I just feel... a little dizzy...","text_treat_53016":"Goodness! Your skin is...","text_treat_53017":"How could this happen? I only left for a short while...","text_treat_53018":"(Gradually lowers her voice) I'm fine! If I were in the Woodland, all I would need to do is take a dip in the spring water...","text_treat_53019":"You're clearly poisoned. Damn it, your symptoms all point to Percival's potion!","text_treat_53020":"(Unable to open her eyes) Leave me be. I—ugh...","text_treat_53021":"(Diana faints.)","text_treat_53022":"Diana!","text_treat_53023":"Hang in there. I'll find you an antidote.","text_treat_53024":"(A while later.)","text_treat_53025":"(You have gone out to gather all the ingredients needed to create an antidote.)","text_treat_53026":" (It didn't go smoothly, but there were no mishaps.)","text_treat_53027":"(You concoct the antidote according to the recipe and return to the room.)","text_treat_53028":"(Diana's breathing grows weaker.)","text_treat_53029":"Diana's getting worse. I have to use the antidote on her now.","text_treat_53030":"(Breathing heavily) Hm... Ngh...","text_treat_53031":"She's responding! The antidote works!","text_treat_53032":"(Rhythmically) Zzz... Zzz...","text_treat_53033":"Her breathing is steady. Let's give her another dose tomorrow.","text_treat_54001":"(Pushes the room's door)","text_treat_54002":"(Sleep-talking) No... Don't...","text_treat_54003":"......","text_treat_54004":"No... Don't...","text_treat_54005":"This can be taken as a good sign!","text_treat_54006":"I'll repeat this once more tomorrow to completely purge the toxin from her!","text_treat_55001":"(Back to Diana's room)","text_treat_55002":"(Inhales deeply) Ahh *Spit*","text_treat_55003":"(Diana regains consciousness and spits out a mouthful of noxious blood.)","text_treat_55004":"Diana! You're finally awake!","text_treat_55005":"W-What's happened to me...? Why are you here?!","text_treat_55006":"You were poisoned by Percival and have been unconscious for two days. I've expelled the toxin from your body.","text_treat_55007":"(Incredulously) I was unconscious for two days? Impossible. How could I possibly be poisoned...!","text_treat_55008":"(Diana tries to get up as she speaks, only to fall back onto her bed weakly.)","text_treat_55009":"Don't move around too much. You need proper rest.","text_treat_55010":"(Firmly) I'm fine!","text_treat_55011":"(Diana tries to sit up and fails once more.)","text_treat_55012":"Let me help you up.","text_treat_55013":"(Grimly) Don't touch me, or I'll chop off your hand!","text_treat_55014":"......","text_treat_55015":"(Diana glances at the antidote and her clothes by the bed.)","text_treat_55016":"(Doubtful) You've been treating me for the past few days?","text_treat_55017":"But I've been careful with where I placed my hands!","text_treat_55018":"(Incredulously) Pfft, humans.","text_treat_55019":"(Sensing her distrust, you anxiously take a step forward.)","text_treat_55020":"(Suddenly getting nervous) D-don't come so close to me...","text_treat_55021":"I haven't done anything improper to you. I swear upon that.","text_treat_55022":"(Deflated) That's not what I meant... Ugh, this antidote smells worse than grizzly's poo. I'm going to take a shower!","text_treat_55023":"(This time, Diana manages to get on her feet and enter the bathroom.)","text_treat_55024":"(You wait for a long while.)","text_treat_55025":"(Hesitantly) I'm done showering.

Come on in then.","text_treat_55028":"(Lowers her head) Sorry about what I said earlier.","text_treat_55029":"What?","text_treat_55030":"(Straight-faced) I must admit that you're a kind and righteous human, unlike the other ones I've met before.","text_treat_55031":"(Blushing) Thank you... for what you did.","text_treat_33001":"(Enduring) Uh, sorry... Omniguardian","text_treat_33002":"Not only failed to protect Mythoria... but even myself...","text_treat_33003":"Don't speak, let me heal you.","text_treat_33004":"It isn't your fault.","text_treat_33005":"... Alright, then... I'll leave it to you...","text_treat_33006":"(Dress her wounds and interact)","text_treat_33007":"(To_Be_Determined暂时未翻译)","text_treat_33008":"Hmm... Mmm, I feel better now that the heavy armor is removed.","text_treat_34001":"(I went to Eluller's room again, this time bringing the Spring of Vitality)","text_treat_34002":"Is that...? The Spring of Vitality! Omniguardian, you really found it.","text_treat_34003":"I always keep my promises...","text_treat_34004":"My sole purpose in life is to protect the Valkyries.","text_treat_34005":"(Blushing slightly) You're right... I just didn't expect you to be so concerned about me.","text_treat_34006":"(To_Be_Determined暂时未翻译)","text_treat_34007":"Humph... Alright, I'll leave it to you... Omniguardian.","text_treat_34008":"(I walk up to Eluller and examine the bleeding wounds on her back...)","text_treat_34009":"Go on and try the Spring of Vitality.","text_treat_34010":"(You dress her wound.)","text_treat_34011":"(To_Be_Determined暂时未翻译)","text_treat_34012":"Phew—Thanks to your help, I feel much more relaxed...","text_treat_34013":"It seems like we need more bottles of Spring of Vitality.","text_treat_34014":"(Smiles) Yeah... I'll be waiting for your good news.","text_treat_34015":"Don't rush to leave just yet. Wait in the living room for a while.","text_treat_34016":"I need to change my clothes. I'll be right there.","text_treat_34017":"......","text_treat_34018":"(Eluller comes out of the bedroom, wearing a more relaxed outfit.)","text_treat_34019":"(She holds a large glass of beer in each hand and hands one to me.)","text_treat_34020":"To thank you for the treatment and for taking care of me... Cheers!","text_treat_34021":"Cheers!","text_treat_34022":"(Eluller raises her cup and takes a hearty sip, then exhales a satisfied breath.)","text_treat_34023":"Ah! After recovering from an injury, celebrating with alcohol is the way to go!","text_treat_34024":"Drinking right after recovering from an injury isn't good for the body, though.","text_treat_34025":"Approaching battles and life with this carefree attitude is my style!","text_treat_34026":"(She bursts into laughter, seemingly unconcerned.)","text_treat_34027":"(But thinking back to the scars I saw on her during the treatment...)","text_treat_34028":"(It's hard not to worry...)","text_treat_34029":"Even so...","text_treat_34030":"During battles, you should still pay attention to your safety.","text_treat_34031":"(Casually) Hmph, for a warrior, scars are marks of glory.","text_treat_34032":"(Blushing) But if it's your advice... I'll seriously consider it in the next battle.","text_treat_34033":"But for now, let's have a toast and enjoy some leisure time away from the battles!","text_treat_35001":"(I've come to Eluller's residence once again. Upon entering, I see her holding a wine goblet and drinking heartily.)","text_treat_35002":"What great timing! Come here and have a drink with me!","text_treat_35003":"(As I approach Eluller, I smell the pungent alcohol emanating from her body.)","text_treat_35004":"Why are you drinking at this time?","text_treat_35005":"What of it? This is tradition.","text_treat_35006":"(Laughs heartily) In the North, we drink when we're happy and we drink when we're sad.","text_treat_35007":"We drink when we're training! And we drink even more before battle!","text_treat_35008":"When are you ever not drinking?","text_treat_35009":"Hm, good question. Let me think...","text_treat_35010":"When we accidentally fall over into the ditch after vomiting because we've drunk too much.","text_treat_35011":"(She shrugs.) Believe me, that's a nasty feeling that you won't ever want to experience.","text_treat_35012":"Hey! Don't ask me how I know about this, and keep it a secret!","text_treat_35013":"(After you nod in agreement, Eluller retrieves a couple of wine goblets from behind her and pushes them toward you.)","text_treat_35014":"Want some?","text_treat_35015":"Accept gladly.","text_treat_35016":"(I raise my goblet with Eluller and down the wine contained within it in a single gulp.)","text_treat_35017":"(It is clear that Eluller's expression has changed after drinking the goblet of wine.)","text_treat_35018":"Now, my friend, I think it's time for us to talk about something more interesting.","text_treat_35019":"What do you want to know?","text_treat_35020":"Ask about the North.","text_treat_35021":"A decent subject to ask about.","text_treat_35022":"The North is a beautiful place.","text_treat_35023":"There are large tundras, large snowy mountains, large ice lakes, large polar bears...","text_treat_35024":"It sounds just like... the North.","text_treat_35025":"What? Don't look at me like that—I'm a warrior, not a poet!","text_treat_35026":"Anyway, the scenery in the North is very beautiful.","text_treat_35027":"If you happen to go there in the future, I'll bring you to see the aurora... It's my favorite.","text_treat_35028":"I know of a good place, where there's a great view and it isn't too cold.","text_treat_35029":"I think that I'll like the place as well.","text_treat_35030":"(Gently laughs) That's for sure!","text_treat_35031":"(As time passes, Eluller drinks goblet after goblet of mellow wine.)","text_treat_35032":"(Unbeknownst to her, signs of tipsiness have crept onto her cheeks and her eyes.)","text_treat_35033":"Oh, forgive my chattiness today.","text_treat_35034":"As a warrior, I have little opportunity to share my thoughts with others.","text_treat_35035":"Thank you for keeping me company.","text_treat_35036":"Perhaps, if given the chance, we can have some fun in the future—you and me, together.","text_treat_35037":"... Perhaps morning exercise isn't a bad choice...","text_treat_35038":"Now, excuse me for a while. I need to find a place to...","text_treat_35039":"Remember to stay away from the ditch!","text_treat_35040":"......","text_treat_35041":"Thank you for the reminder.","text_treat_36001":"(Fulfilling my promise to exercise together with Eluller in the morning, I arrive early at her residence to wait for her...)","text_treat_36002":"(She seems to still be in her bedroom. I decide to...)","text_treat_36003":"Knock on her door and check when she'll be ready...","text_treat_36004":"(Loudly) Come in, I'll be ready soon!","text_treat_36005":"(Pushing the door open, I see Eluller standing beside her bed tidying up her golden hair.)","text_treat_36006":"(Seeing this unfamiliar side of the Valkyrie at home, I'm a little surprised...)","text_treat_36007":"(Smiles) Don't be so surprised. Although I'm a warrior, I'm still female after all.","text_treat_36008":"Dressing up before going out is a house rule that must be strictly followed within my family.","text_treat_36009":"House rule...","text_treat_36010":"You mean between you and Athena?","text_treat_36011":"Yes, Athena...","text_treat_36012":"My elder sister has always held me to the strictest house rules.","text_treat_36013":"How's your relationship with each other?","text_treat_36014":"(Hesitant) Well... That's complicated.","text_treat_36015":"To keep it simple, there's some misunderstandings between us.","text_treat_36016":"At that time, I was extremely furious, so I chose to run away from home.","text_treat_36017":"Thereafter, I decided to head north and encountered dangers along the way. It was then that I met my mentor, Björn.","text_treat_36018":"This was how I managed to become a Northerner.","text_treat_36019":"What happened after that...","text_treat_36020":"Did the misunderstanding get cleared up?","text_treat_36021":"(At this point, Eluller seems to suddenly recall something. She becomes quite angry.)","text_treat_36022":"Later on, I discovered that Athena had planned all of this.","text_treat_36023":"Back then, Dawn City was in the midst of a coup and she thought that I'd be in danger if I continued to stay there.","text_treat_36024":"Hence, she took the opportunity to send me toward the North to train myself and become stronger...","text_treat_36025":"Your sister truly loves you.","text_treat_36026":"(Nods lightly) I know... She has done so much for me, but has not said anything about it all this time.","text_treat_36027":"(Sighs) Whenever I sit by the window and look out at the city...","text_treat_36028":"As I look at the peaceful and prosperous city, I will think of my sister...","text_treat_36029":"At this moment, the world is facing a massive crisis... She's been leading the soldiers of the Empire to resist against the Demons.","text_treat_36030":"Don't worry, we'll defeat the Demons for sure...","text_treat_36031":"At that time, your sister will certainly be proud of you...","text_treat_36032":"(Smiles) I believe you.","text_treat_36033":"Let's prepare to set out! Our morning exercise should not be delayed any further!","text_treat_36034":"For many years, Athena has been secretly protecting me...","text_treat_36035":"(Determined) So I shall protect her and the people of the Empire this time!","text_treat_36036":"(Blushing) I have a feeling that I can make good on my word! As long as you're with me...","text_treat_23001":"Ugh... It feels terrible to be drained of all magic...","text_treat_23002":"Omniguardian, I'm so tired...","text_treat_23003":"I'll replenish your magic.","text_treat_23004":"I'll help you.","text_treat_23005":"Replenish my magic? Ah... That brings back memories. You've done that for me before.","text_treat_23006":"I... I'm ready.","text_treat_23007":"Is there anything I can do for you?","text_treat_23008":"Feeling better?","text_treat_23009":"How do you feel?","text_treat_23010":"My strength is coming back to me. It feels... warm, and nice.","text_treat_23011":"I feel like... taking a nap...","text_treat_23012":"Get some shut-eye, then.","text_treat_23013":"Okay. Wait for me... I will recover my power.","text_treat_23014":"(Falls deep in thought) Hmm... Let me see... You are my Omniguardian, so...","text_treat_23015":"Maybe you can try channeling your magic to me to speed up my recovery.","text_treat_23016":"But that will greatly weaken you... Are you sure you want to do that for me?","text_treat_23017":"Of course!","text_treat_23018":"All right...","text_treat_23019":"Follow my lead and channel your magic to me...","text_treat_23020":"(Tap to Heal.)","text_treat_23021":"(Stretches) Ah... Your magic feels as warm as the sun...","text_treat_23022":"I feel a lot better now...","text_treat_23023":"Have a good rest.","text_treat_23024":"I'll come back to heal you again.","text_treat_23025":"(Smiles) All right then. I'm looking forward to it.","text_treat_23026":"(Whispers) Good night, darling.","text_treat_24001":"(When I return to the magic workshop, Dorabella is already sitting up and expecting me...)","text_treat_24002":"I'm here to help with your recovery, Dorabella...","text_treat_24003":"All right. I hope you remember how to from my previous guidance.","text_treat_24004":"(Tap to Heal.)","text_treat_24005":"(Eyebrows relax) Thank you, I feel better now...","text_treat_25001":"(When I return to the magic workshop, Dorabella is already sitting up and expecting me...)","text_treat_25002":"(Happy) You're finally here. I've been waiting for you...","text_treat_25003":"Sorry to keep you waiting, Dorabella...","text_treat_25004":"(Tap to Heal.)","text_treat_25005":"(Indulging) Your comforting warmth... is flowing within me...","text_treat_25006":"I think I may have become hooked on you...","text_treat_26001":"(When I return to the magic workshop, Dorabella is already sitting up and expecting me...)","text_treat_26002":"(Delighted) Darling? Are you here?","text_treat_26003":"Phew... I thought you've forgotten about me.","text_treat_26004":"......","text_treat_26005":"(Smiles) Relax, I'm just kidding.","text_treat_26006":"You never have to worry, Dorabella...","text_treat_26007":"I won't ever forget you...","text_treat_26008":"(Surprised) Oh? What a bold thing to say...","text_treat_26009":"I can't wait for you to heal me, darling.","text_treat_26010":"(Tap to interact.)","text_treat_26011":"You're looking a lot better than before.","text_treat_26012":"(Smiles) I've completely regained my magic, all thanks to your generous help.","text_treat_26013":"Let's go to the dining hall. I'll make you some tea.","text_treat_26014":"......","text_treat_26015":"(A while later in the dining hall, Dorabella suddenly appears with tea and desserts...)","text_treat_26016":"(The Ethereal Valkyrie hands you a hot cup of tea.)","text_treat_26017":"Are these... created with magic?","text_treat_26018":"(Chuckles) These are genuine and edible treats I specially prepared for you.","text_treat_26019":"You've used up a lot of your magic to heal me. This is my way of thanking you.","text_treat_26020":"Go on, drink this tea. It'll benefit you.","text_treat_26021":"(The warm and comforting tea flows down my throat and into my stomach, melting away all the fatigue that resulted from using my magic during treatment...)","text_treat_26022":"Fragrant and refreshing...","text_treat_26023":"This is delicious. Thank you.","text_treat_26024":"It's my pleasure, darling.","text_treat_26025":"If you need a respite or somewhere to relax, you can always come by my place...","text_treat_27001":"(Shortly after completing her treatment, I accept Dorabella's invitation to visit her.)","text_treat_27002":"(Dorabella warmly welcomes me with tea and desserts, like the last time.)","text_treat_27003":"So... Is there something you need from me?","text_treat_27004":"(Smiles) Nothing actually.","text_treat_27005":"I just want to spend a relaxing afternoon with you over tea.","text_treat_27006":"(Plays with her hair) Or should I only invite you over if there's something important?","text_treat_27007":"... Of course not.","text_treat_27008":"I'm always up for afternoon tea.","text_treat_27009":"(The warm and comforting tea flows down my throat and into my stomach, instantly melting away all my tension.)","text_treat_27010":"I made you catnip tea this time. It's known for its soothing and relaxation properties.","text_treat_27011":"Thank you. You're really thoughtful...","text_treat_27012":"(Smiles) Interesting... Not many would choose to describe me this way.","text_treat_27013":"You should know that many would panic at the sight of me.","text_treat_27014":"... Why is that?","text_treat_27015":"Perhaps humans fear the things that they cannot fathom, in the same way they fear magic...","text_treat_27016":"(Furrows her brows) \"Monster\" and \"Freak\"... They used to call me that when I was young.","text_treat_27017":"Outrageous!","text_treat_27018":"You're right... but I've already punished them in my own way.","text_treat_27019":"How so?","text_treat_27020":"There was one occasion at prom...","text_treat_27021":"I used my magic and left a few mean girls suspended upside-down from the ceiling the entire night.","text_treat_27022":"(Chuckles) Don't look at me like that. They went around spreading rumors about me bewitching their boyfriends with magic...","text_treat_27023":"They even got ink all over my favorite dress.","text_treat_27024":"You wouldn't mind the petty little things I did when I was young, would you?","text_treat_27025":"... I guess so...","text_treat_27026":"I mean, I don't want to be left suspended upside-down all night...","text_treat_27027":"(Smiles) I like your sense of humor.","text_treat_27028":"Don't worry, darling. I will never do that to you.","text_treat_27029":"(Winks) You're the most special person to me after all...","text_treat_28001":"(Dorabella is in the library, devoting all of her attention to the book she's reading.)","text_treat_28002":"(Out of boredom, I pick up a book within my reach and decide to flip through it...)","text_treat_28003":"(The moment I open the book, its pages let out a piercing scream, startling me so much that I reflexively fling the book across the room...)","text_treat_28004":"(Smiles) Be careful, darling. These aren't your normal books. They contain records of actual magic.","text_treat_28005":"The power of these recorded magic also determines how dangerous the books are.","text_treat_28006":"Hmm... What kind of magic is this book about?","text_treat_28007":"(Recollecting) Let me see if I can remember... Probably a transformation spell...","text_treat_28008":"Casting this spell correctly would turn a human into a groundhog.","text_treat_28009":"A groundhog...?","text_treat_28010":"Uh-huh. This spell brings back such memories.","text_treat_28011":"That means... you've used it before?","text_treat_28012":"Of course. There's no transformation spell I know better than this.","text_treat_28013":"It's the one I cast on my \"dearest\" mentor, after all.","text_treat_28014":"You've piqued my curiosity now... What happened?","text_treat_28015":"(Frowns) Well... He stole my powers and used it to earn the High Mages' recognition.","text_treat_28016":"During his much-anticipated moment of glory, I broke into the temple and turned him into a groundhog.","text_treat_28017":"(Smiles) He was made an utter laughingstock in front of everybody.","text_treat_28018":"It's a shame that this ended up causing tension between the Mage Council and myself, though.","text_treat_28019":"You'd have just let me off the hook if you were in their shoes, right?","text_treat_28020":"Hm... I suppose so...?","text_treat_28021":"(Sighs) Ah well. If only those old fogies from the Mage Council were as understanding as you.","text_treat_28022":"I guess so... Still, you should learn some self-restraint.","text_treat_28023":"(Reluctantly) If you say so, darling. After all, I should take your advice since you're my Omniguardian.","text_treat_28024":"If this ever happens again, I'll make sure to sit down and clarify things with the old mages.","text_treat_28025":"(Smiles) Or I could just send them straight to the bottom of the ocean and turn them into shark bait...","text_treat_56001":"(Upon coming to Diana's again, you discover that she's in the bathroom this time too.)","text_treat_56002":"You're here. Nice timing, I just finished my bath.","text_treat_56003":"(Relaxed) Whew, I feel so much better now!","text_treat_56004":"Looks like you've taken a liking to the bath here.","text_treat_56005":"The water's nowhere near as clear as the woodland springs', but... it's not half bad.","text_treat_56006":"From what I understand, it also uses underground well water as a water source, so the water should be very clear.","text_treat_56007":"(Stuck for words) ... It just isn't the same, okay!","text_treat_56008":"You'll get used to this place over time.","text_treat_56009":"I'm not planning to stay long.","text_treat_56010":"This isn't my home.","text_treat_56011":"I'm going back after we finish our mission to save the world.","text_treat_56012":"I hope this day isn't too far off.","text_treat_56013":"So... do people living in the woodland all bathe outdoors?","text_treat_56014":"(Shrill) What? Of course not! What are you thinking?!","text_treat_56015":"We fetch water and then bring it indoors to bathe in, of course!","text_treat_56016":"Some larger settlements also direct water from the streams to their yards.","text_treat_56017":"Doesn't that make bathing a chore?","text_treat_56018":"Not to me. We're all used to doing it this way.","text_treat_56019":"(Gently) Besides, there were many kids in every household back then. Enjoying a bath with your sisters was also a precious way to unwind.","text_treat_56020":"Dinah, Beatrice, Bella, Gitty...","text_treat_56021":"(A faraway look enters Diana's eyes, as though she's caught up in her memories of the woodland.)","text_treat_56022":"(But it doesn't take long before she shakes it off.)","text_treat_56023":"(Sharply) Are you planning to stand at the door forever? I'm going out soon!","text_treat_56024":"Shall I bring you your clothes and a towel?","text_treat_56025":"No, it's fine!","text_treat_57001":"(Diana has asked you to help her buy some clothes.)","text_treat_57002":"(Bring them to her today.)","text_treat_57003":"(After receiving the clothes, Diana takes a long while changing in the room before she finally opens the door.)","text_treat_57004":"......","text_treat_57005":"Wow! This outfit... it's perfect on you!","text_treat_57006":"Are these clothes... really meant for me?","text_treat_57007":"Of course!","text_treat_57008":"(Raises her voice) Why did you get me clothes like these?!","text_treat_57009":"Is something wrong?","text_treat_57010":"This outfit is way too tight!","text_treat_57011":"Why is it so form-fitting?!","text_treat_57012":"Is there even a need for this tail-like contraption?","text_treat_57013":"And the heels are so high that I can't even run or jump! I can't fight in this at all!","text_treat_57014":"This isn't a combat suit.","text_treat_57015":"Then why do I have to wear them?","text_treat_57016":"It's safe at home. You don't have to fight here.","text_treat_57017":"This doesn't suit me. I need clothes that I can fight in.","text_treat_57018":"Occasionally trying out human clothing can be a novel experience.","text_treat_57019":"Why don't you try these out yourself, then?","text_treat_57020":"Unfortunately, they don't come in my size.","text_treat_57021":"These clothes are specially designed for human ladies.","text_treat_57022":"I don't care. I want to see you in them.","text_treat_57023":"As you wish.","text_treat_57024":"(After speaking, you immediately make a move to disrobe.)","text_treat_57025":"(Panics) Wait, wait! What are you doing?!","text_treat_57026":"Trying the clothes out with you, of course.","text_treat_57027":"(As though she just conjured up a scary image in her mind, Diana shakes her head wildly.)","text_treat_57028":"Never mind, I take my words back...","text_treat_57029":"All right!","text_treat_57030":"(Mutters) I'll... try wearing these for a while first, then...","text_treat_57031":"You'll love it.","text_treat_57032":"I'll be the one to decide that.","text_treat_57033":"By the way, the outfit should have also come with a headband with ears on it.","text_treat_57034":"(Blushes) You're doing this on purpose!","text_treat_96001":"(Face twisted with pain) I'm... sorry... I didn't mean to... bring any trouble...","text_treat_96002":"I was so scared when the cage came down...","text_treat_96003":"You're safe now.","text_treat_96004":"Don't be afraid. I'm here.","text_treat_96005":"(Weeping) But... when I close my eyes, I feel surrounded by the darkness of that terrifying cage...","text_treat_96006":"Omniguardian, will you stay... for a while?","text_treat_96007":"I won't leave you.","text_treat_96008":"I'll stay for as long as you need.","text_treat_96009":"That will be great...","text_treat_96010":"Well, could you... pat my head?","text_treat_96011":"Of course.","text_treat_96012":"Mmm... It's not that scary anymore...","text_treat_96013":"By the way, Dorabella, remember to go check out the Thornwoods...","text_treat_96014":"Alright, I will.","text_treat_96015":"Okay, I will.","text_treat_96016":"Don't think that. Everyone is worth something and that applies to you, too.","text_treat_96017":"You... You've experienced so much hardship because of me and it has cost you so, so much...","text_treat_96018":"I did what I had to do. I would do anything to save you because you're far more important to me than any price I've had to pay.","text_treat_96019":"...Do you really think that?","text_treat_96020":"Of course. You're my precious Valkyrie.","text_treat_96021":"(Holding a hand out to Elune) Come on, let's help you face your fear. I'll be here the whole way. I promise.","text_treat_96022":"(Hesitant) ...","text_treat_96023":"...I can't... I don't think this is going to work... (Elune shakes her head dejectedly.)","text_treat_96024":"That's alright. Some things take time, and we have plenty of that to spare. Just remember one thing. I won't give up on you. Ever.","text_treat_96025":"I do feel a little better after hearing what you said. I just... I think I just need a little more time.","text_treat_96026":"And I have a request. Can you... Can you come spend time with me more often?","text_treat_96027":"Of course. Until you're completely free of this fear, I'll be here for you.","text_treat_96028":"(Smiling at you gratefully) Thank you.","text_treat_97001":"(Trembling) I'm sorry... I... I can't help it... I'm still... so afraid... I'm so scared...","text_treat_97002":"Console Elune","text_treat_97003":"(Thanks to you soothing her, Elune eventually calms down.)","text_treat_97004":"I think I feel better now...","text_treat_97005":"(Looks like it'll take more time to help Elune conquer her fear. You'll have to come back a few more times.)","text_treat_98001":"You know, there's a thought that keeps circling in my head...","text_treat_98002":"If I wasn't a Valkyrie, would I be free from having to endure this anguish...?","text_treat_98003":"Console Elune","text_treat_98004":"(You console Elune once more. You can see color slowly return to her eyes.)","text_treat_98005":"I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't say things like that...","text_treat_98006":"I won't do it again. I promise, so please... Have faith in me.","text_treat_98007":"(Elune looks a lot better than before. It looks like she'll recover before long.)","text_treat_99001":"(Smiling) You're here...","text_treat_99002":"I'm glad. You're looking a lot better. I knew you wouldn't let this defeat you. Ready to take the most important step?","text_treat_99003":"Hold out a hand to Elune.","text_treat_99004":"(Elune takes a deep breath as she looks at your outstretched hand, her gaze becoming determined.)","text_treat_99005":"I... I'm ready! (Elune takes your hand and, with a burst of courage, leaps out of the wardrobe.)","text_treat_99006":"I did it!","text_treat_99007":"You did it! You challenged yourself and won, Valkyrie Elune!","text_story_91001":"Hey! I was about to go look for you. I prepared a gift for you, to thank you for helping me before.","text_story_91002":"Oh, how nice of you. Let's see here... Wow! This is... a... uh?","text_story_91003":"A mouse...?","text_story_91004":"That's right! (Elune extends her claws that are holding the mouse toward you, looking at you expectantly.)","text_story_91005":"Uhm... What gave you the idea for this gift?","text_story_91006":"(Flapping wings excitedly) My friend Alby told me about this.","text_story_91007":"Who is Alby?","text_story_91008":"Alby is the black cat living in Eluller's house. She adores her owner, so she always catches mice for Eluller. She told me that this works wonders. (Her claw reaches closer.) Here, you can have it!","text_story_91009":"Accept reluctantly.","text_story_91010":"Decline nicely.","text_story_91011":"(Accepting the mouse) Thank you for your gift, Elune. I... quite like it, really.","text_story_91012":"Great! I'll get you a few more. Wait here. (Before you say anything, Elune flies off.)","text_story_91013":"(Speechless)...","text_story_91014":"(You look at the chubby mouse in your hand, only to find it staring back at you with its beady eyes. You both fall into awkward silence...)","text_story_91015":"Thank you for your kind gesture, but... there's a possibility that some of us don't normally eat such a thing...","text_story_91016":"(Astonished) How could that be?! Alby said that she always gives this to Eluller.","text_story_91017":"Did she mention that Eluller accepts the gift and eats it every time?","text_story_91018":"Of course... Oh, no, wait... (Tilting her head and pondering) She didn't seem to mention that at all...","text_story_91019":"Exactly. (You look at Elune and shrug with resignation.)","text_story_91020":"All right, looks like this really doesn't work... But it's fine. I'll see what else I can give to you as a gift. What could it be...? Perhaps I can try a snake, a frog, or a hedgehog... Anyway, wait here. I'll be back soon.","text_story_91021":"(Before you speak, Elune flaps her wings and flies off again. You see the chubby mouse flailing its short, tiny limbs in protest. It looks absolutely hilarious.)","text_story_92001":"You always appear whenever I think of you.","text_story_92002":"Are you bathing in hot spring? It doesn't seem to be your kind's habit.","text_story_92003":"It indeed isn't. I just heard a legend and... I'm, uh, contemplating it.","text_story_92004":"Are you willing to share what's on your mind?","text_story_92005":"Sure, have you heard of the Spring of Aeyrl? It's a wellspring brimming with magic power. Legend has it, if someone bathes in the Spring of Aeyrl, their body will turn into that of a human.","text_story_92006":"Unfortunately, no one knows where the Spring of Aeyrl is.","text_story_92007":"Why do you want to be a human?","text_story_92008":"I... I don't really like my body. You might not know this, but most of my sufferings have been caused by my appearance. The others look at me like I'm a monster. It makes me feel uneasy.","text_story_92009":"So I've been thinking... If I can change myself and transform into a human, then I might not have to deal with problems like this anymore. Right?","text_story_92010":"How I wish this well is the Spring of Aeyrl...","text_story_92011":"Besides...","text_story_92012":"Hm?","text_story_92013":"(Elune suddenly lowers her voice, which becomes almost inaudible.) I'm thinking that... if I become a human, then perhaps I can be with you.","title_elite_4010":"Interactive 1","title_elite_4011":"Interactive 2","text_story_100011":"By the way, while I'm still sober.","text_story_100017":"This is for you.","text_story_100012":"Is this?","text_story_100013":"Is a reward I received during my previous garrisoning in the North, it means a lot to me.","text_story_100014":"Then why did you give it to me?","text_story_100015":"Stop the nonsense, just take it and take good care of it.","text_story_100016":"Okay, I will take good care of it for you.","text_story_100021":"I want to thank you for your previous help and I want to give you something.","text_story_100022":"It can't be this a poor mouse...","text_story_100023":"Sorry... Took the wrong one, this is for you.","text_story_100024":"What a beautiful feather, is this...?","text_story_100025":"It's not my feather... It's a sacred relic within our clan, and you can consider it as... a keepsake...","text_story_100026":"It's too valuable.","text_story_100027":"If you are in deep danger take out this feather and I will be able to fly to your side.","text_story_100028":"To protect you.","text_story_100029":"Thank you. I'll keep it safe.","text_story_100031":"Here's something for you.","text_story_100037":"Don't thank me too much.","text_story_100032":"Is this?","text_story_100033":"It's an item that I used for learning magic, but it's useless now.","text_story_100034":"Is this filled with your magic power?","text_story_100035":"Good observation, now it is equivalent to an arcane level magic bomb, use it carefully!","text_story_100036":"I can guarantee you that there shouldn't be a time where I use it.","text_story_100041":"A certain person entrusted me to give you this thing, saying that you will definitely recognize it.","text_story_100042":"Why I don't have this kind of treatment?!","text_story_100043":"Arkdina?","text_story_100044":"Don't you think it's rude to mention another woman's name in front of one woman?","text_story_100045":"Why did she give me this?","text_story_100046":"I'm not the one who likes to pry into people's secrets.","text_story_100047":"Why don't you ask her yourself when you see her?","text_story_100051":"I'm a little jealous of all the things you've gotten from other girls.","text_story_100052":"......","text_story_100053":"I want to give you something too.","text_story_100054":"You have to put it in a place to stand out.","text_story_100055":"......","text_story_100056":"Dislike me now? That's not the attitude you had when you coaxed me.","text_story_100057":"I'm so sad!","text_story_100058":"Fine, I'll take it.","text_story_100061":"I picked up an interesting thing in the Woodland that doesn't look like it's from there.","text_story_100067":"Do you know where it came from?","text_story_100062":"What a delicate conch, and a faint elemental aroma.","text_story_100063":"Could this be an item lost by someone?","text_story_100064":"It's quite possible.","text_story_100065":"Then can I ask you to keep it for a while?","text_story_100066":"No problem.","text_story_100071":"Interesting stuff, it has a strong life magic.","text_story_100070":"Check it out.","text_story_100072":"What is it?","text_story_100073":"I'm not sure at the moment, it seems to be a magic weapon of some foreign civilization.","text_story_100074":"Foreign civilization?","text_story_100075":"It means I don't recognize it. Do I have to make it so clear, you dummy?","text_story_100076":"That's not what I meant...","text_story_100077":"Are you interested? How about, you help me study it?","text_story_100078":"Uhm...","text_story_100079":"It's settled. I'll come back to you in a couple of months to get the results of the study.","note_goddess_not_ready":"It's not time yet","note_goddess_name_unknow":"Unknown","text_talk_6008":"Big brother says that Ellie should not let anyone touch her hands. However... you're an exception.","text_treat_35101":"(Loosens the overcoat) Just need to apply the potion to the wound.","text_treat_35102":"It might sting a little.","text_treat_35103":"Tell me if it's too much.","text_treat_35104":"I'll be fine. Wounds come with the package if one wants to be a warrior.","text_treat_35105":"Let's do this. I can't wait to recover my power!","text_treat_35106":"Okay.","text_treat_35107":"(Use the Sacred Galo to heal Eluller)","text_treat_35108":"(To_Be_Determined暂时未翻译)","text_treat_35109":"(The Sacred Galo covers Eluller's wounds, but the effect is limited)","text_treat_35110":"Ugh...","text_treat_35111":"The bleeding has almost stopped. How do you feel?","text_treat_35112":"You'll fully recover soon after this treatment.","text_treat_35113":"(Stretching arms) I barely feel any pain, and I can move around much better.","text_treat_36101":"After this treatment, the wounds should heal.","text_treat_36102":"(Using the Spring of Vitality interaction)","text_treat_36103":"(To_Be_Determined暂时未翻译)","text_treat_36104":"My body is able to move freely now.","text_treat_36105":"(Eluller shrugs her shoulders and then stretches her arms...)","text_treat_36106":"(She appears to have recovered well.)","text_treat_36107":"Don't rush to leave just yet. Wait in the living room for a while.","text_treat_36108":"I need to change my clothes.

It's known for its soothing and relaxation properties.","text_story_120050210":"Thank you. You're very thoughtful.","text_story_120050211":"(Chuckles) Interesting... Very few would use the word \"thoughtful\" to describe me.","text_story_120050212":"You should know that many would panic at the sight of me.","text_story_120050213":"... Why is that?","text_story_120050214":"Perhaps because humans naturally fear the things they do not understand. In this case, my magic...","text_story_120050215":"(Frowns) \"Monster,\" \"freak\"... That's what they called me when I was younger.","text_story_120050216":"Outrageous!","text_story_120050217":"You're right... but I've already punished them in my own way.","text_story_120050218":"Such as...?","text_story_120050219":"There was one occasion at prom...","text_story_120050220":"I used magic on some nasty girls and left them dangling upside-down from the ceiling for the whole night.","text_story_120050221":"(Chuckles) Don't look at me like that. They went around spreading rumors about me bewitching their boyfriends with magic...","text_story_120050222":"They even got ink all over my favorite dress.","text_story_120050223":"You wouldn't judge me for the silly things I did in my early days, would you?","text_story_120050224":"I wouldn't dare...","text_story_120050225":"(Smiles) I like your sense of humor.","text_story_120050226":"Don't worry. I won't do anything like that to you.","text_story_120050227":"(Winks) After all, you're my one-and-only Omniguardian.","text_story_120050301":"(Dorabella is in the library, devoting all of her attention to the book she's reading.)","text_story_120050302":"(Out of boredom, I pick up a book within my reach and decide to flip through it...)","text_story_120050303":"(The moment I open the book, its pages let out a piercing scream, startling me so much that I reflexively fling the book across the room...)","text_story_120050304":"(Smiles) Take caution, Omniguardian. These aren't your normal books. They contain records of real magic.","text_story_120050305":"The power of these recorded magic also determines how dangerous the books are.","text_story_120050306":"What kind of magic is this book about?","text_story_120050307":"(Recollecting) Let me see if I can remember... Probably a transformation spell...","text_story_120050308":"Casting this spell correctly would turn a human into a groundhog.","text_story_120050309":"A groundhog...?","text_story_120050310":"Uh-huh. This spell brings back such memories.","text_story_120050311":"...Have you used this magic before?","text_story_120050312":"Of course. There's no transformation spell I know better than this.","text_story_120050313":"It's the one I cast on my \"dearest\" mentor, after all.","text_story_120050314":"What happened?","text_story_120050315":"(Frowns) Well... He stole my powers and ascended to the rank of Great Mage.","text_story_120050316":"During his much-anticipated moment of glory, I broke into the temple and turned him into a groundhog.","text_story_120050317":"(Grins) He got what he deserved—I made him an utter laughingstock in front of everybody.","text_story_120050318":"However, the Mage Council wasn't on my side.","text_story_120050319":"It brought a lot of tension between the Mage Council and me.","text_story_120050320":"You'd have just let me off the hook if you were in their shoes, right?","text_story_120050321":"Hm... I suppose so...?","text_story_120050322":"(Sighs) Ah well. If only those old fogies from the Mage Council were as understanding as you.","text_story_120050323":"Maybe you should exercise more self-control.","text_story_120050324":"(Reluctantly) If you say so, Omniguardian. As your Valkyrie, I suppose I should follow your advice.","text_story_120050325":"If this ever happens again, I'll make sure to sit down and clarify things with the old mages.","text_story_120050326":"(Smirks) Or I could send them straight to the bottom of the sea and turn them into shark bait...","text_treat_230020201":"Thank you, Omniguardian. I feel a lot better now.","text_treat_230020202":"Please remember me...","text_treat_230020301":"I need... more courage.","text_treat_230020401":"(I enter the room but do not see Elune anywhere.)","text_treat_230020402":"(I open the closet door and see her curled up like a ball in the narrow space, looking anxious.)","text_treat_230020403":"You're finally here... Omniguardian.","text_treat_230020404":"How are you feeling today?","text_treat_230020405":"(Sighs) I had the same nightmare again. I dreamed of being encaged by humans.","text_treat_230020406":"I dreamed of my sisters being slaughtered by the Abyss monsters...","text_treat_230020407":"Relax. I'm here with you.","text_treat_230020408":"(Smiles) Thank you. Those painful memories are fading from my mind...","text_treat_230020409":"I owe it to the Woodland and the world to be courageous and overcome the nightmares of my past.","text_treat_230020410":"I will serve my duty as a \"Valkyrie\" and never fail you.","text_treat_230020411":"You have what it takes, Elune.","text_treat_230020412":"You are so kind to care about me...","text_treat_230020413":"I can't wait to see you again under a clear sky. I will prepare a token of gratitude for you.","text_story_230020101":"(Elune swoops down as soon as I set foot in the courtyard. She folds her wings and lands with a big smile in front of me.)","text_story_230020102":"Hey! I was just about to find you.","text_story_230020103":"I brought a gift to thank you for your help.","text_story_230020104":"This is, eh... a mouse?","text_story_230020105":"Yep!","text_story_230020106":"(Elune presents the mouse to me and looks at me eagerly.)","text_story_230020107":"Why this gift?","text_story_230020108":"(Flapping wings excitedly) My friend Alby told me about this.","text_story_230020109":"And who is \"Alby\"...?","text_story_230020110":"Alby is the black cat in Eluller's house.","text_story_230020111":"She adores her master and brings mice to Eluller all the time. She told me it works wonders.","text_story_230020112":"(Extending her claws) Eat up!","text_story_230020113":"But... We don't usually eat this.","text_story_230020114":"(Astonished) How could that be?! Alby said that she always gives this to Eluller.","text_story_230020115":"Did she say Eluller ate it?","text_story_230020116":"(Thinking) Of course. Wait, uh... No, I don't think she mentioned that.","text_story_230020117":"All right, I guess it doesn't work...","text_story_230020118":"No worries. I'll keep searching for the best gift.","text_story_230020119":"What else can I get you? A snake? A frog? Or, a hedgehog? ...Anyway, I'll be back!","text_story_230020120":"(Elune spreads her wings and soars into the sky before I could say anything.)","text_story_230020121":"(The plump little mouse flails its short limbs in protest. It looks quite amusing...)","text_story_230020201":"(Elune quickly flies toward me when I enter the courtyard.)","text_story_230020202":"(Bashfully) Hey, you're here.","text_story_230020203":"Yeah. I'm here to see you.","text_story_230020204":"(Delighted) Thanks for visiting me often. You always give me a sense of true freedom.","text_story_230020205":"And I am finally liberated from the terrors of my past...","text_story_230020206":"What happened to you?","text_story_230020207":"A long time ago, human nobles locked me up in a tiny cage. I had no freedom in any way.","text_story_230020208":"It was the bleakest time of my life, but my only friend, Karinya, filled me with hope and a longing to soar again.","text_story_230020209":"And after that...?","text_story_230020210":"Whenever I had time, I secretly practiced flying with the shackles.","text_story_230020211":"I was improving very slowly, but my longing for freedom kept me going.","text_story_230020212":"(Sadly) In the end, Karinya gave up her life to set me free...","text_story_230020213":"After breaking the shackles, I slaughtered the nobles with a whirlwind and reclaimed my freedom.","text_story_230020214":"Omniguardian, you may have forgotten, but it was you who found me in the woods, fallen and broken... Then you brought me to the temple and healed me.","text_story_230020215":"(Tearing up) You gave me freedom...","text_story_230020216":"You earned it with courage.","text_story_230020217":"(Radiating) Thank you for your kind words.

Among them, Princess Marina, due to her noble birth and exceptional magical talent, is hailed as the \"Pearl of Mandana.\"\n\nMarina is perhaps the most curious mermaid in the world, finding the world beyond her domain irresistibly attractive. Despite the efforts of the Vaya tribe to avoid contact with the outside world for centuries, Marina always manages to find opportunities to slip away. Relying on her unparalleled magical abilities, she easily bypasses her fellow tribesmen guarding the territory. While the tribe members are vexed by this behavior, they are helpless against this gem of the archipelago.\n\nDuring one of her excursions, Marina is drawn by a faint light. Following its direction, she encounters a rare Emperor Clam with pearls shimmering inside its shell. Several humans hover around the Emperor Clam, incessantly attempting to pry it open. Hearing the clam's cries for help, Marina uses her magic to disperse the crowd, rescuing the clam and gaining a new friend in the process.","text_elite_9002":"What Marina didn't know was that those expelled humans belonged to a notorious pirate crew. They tracked Marina's trail and found the Vaya tribe back then, mermaids were still considered valuable commodities on land. The pirates raided the tribe, capturing the unprepared mermaids en masse.\n\nFacing a large and prepared pirate force, Marina's magic was no match. Just as she was pushed to the brink, the giant clam suddenly expelled the pearl it had been nurturing, placing it into Marina's hands. The moment Marina touched the pearl, she felt a wondrous resonance, and her magical power, amplified by this resonance, transformed into towering waves hundreds of meters high, surging fiercely towards the surrounding pirate ships, swallowing them all. Marina thus gained the blessing power of the ocean, eventually being appointed as the Glorious Valkyrie, safeguarding the creatures sailing the seas. It's worth noting that after Marina became a Valkyrie, all transactions involving mermaids were swiftly banned.","text_elite_9003":"The Glorious Valkyrie carried out her mission, enduring through long periods until she fell into the bone-chilling mire on the Bonegnaw Swamp. Rescued and recuperating in Mirlond, Marina heard faint mermaid songs in her ears. Following the melodies, she returned to the Mandana Islands only to discover that the entire Vaya tribe had collectively sacrificed themselves, transforming into lingering souls haunting the islands, all to seal the physical form of the ocean lord, Hydra, from the abyss. Marina descended into the remnants of the tribe and found Hydra's soul inhabiting a mermaid with a shark tail, the childhood companion, Lamia. Heartbroken by Lamia's betrayal of their people, Marina accepted the self-sacrifice of the mermaid souls. She gained the power of the entire tribe at the cost of losing all her kin and broke free from the curse restricting the mermaids. Eventually, Hydra's soul vanished amidst the mermaids' songs.\n\nThus, Marina became the last Vayan in the world. The loss of her kin left an unfillable void in the heart of the Glorious Valkyrie, driving her to crave companionship and acceptance even more. To fight alongside others, Marina chose to remain in Mirlond. The Omniguardian crafted a vast aquarium for her, filled with corals, shells, and small fish. However, apart from her elusive foe, Lamia, no one else in the world could sway their tails like Marina.","hero_name_1026":"Marina","text_treat_220040101":"Ugh, I hate waking up from a deep sleep...

How come you're here?","text_story_230020404":"I've come to inspect the nearby Abyss Seal.","text_story_230020405":"And you? Why are you here?","text_story_230020406":"I came to participate in their summer festival. I... I really enjoy these human customs.","text_story_230020407":"Summer festival?","text_story_230020408":"Yes. On this day, people dance throughout the night, welcoming the first light of summer morning together.","text_story_230020409":"Elune says as she mimics the moves of the people, but almost stumbles due to losing balance.","text_story_230020410":"I catch her just in time. The girl is lighter than I imagined, like a feather falling into my arms.","text_story_230020411":"I wrap my arm around her back, helping her stand steady again.","text_story_230020412":"I'm sorry, Omniguardian...","text_story_230020413":"It's alright.","text_story_230020414":"As you can see, I've tried many times, but... I still can't dance like them.","text_story_230020415":"Maybe I'm not suited for dancing, and I shouldn't have joined the festival...","text_story_230020416":"That's not true.","text_story_230020417":"You just need to find a different stage.","text_story_230020418":"What do you mean?","text_story_230020419":"Why not dance in the sky?","text_story_230020420":"You belong to the sky.","text_story_230020421":"I seem to... understand what you mean now. Thank you, Omniguardian.","text_story_230020422":"Elune spreads her wings, stretches her body, and glides into the sky with grace. She joyfully flies for a while before descending back to the ground.","text_story_230020423":"Omniguardian, you have once again enlightened me.","text_story_230020424":"I heard that humans dance with their closest ones during the festival. Omniguardian, can you dance with me?","text_story_230020425":"But I can't fly...","text_story_230020426":"Can I fly too?","text_story_230020427":"I'm a \"Windcaller.\" Believe in me.","text_story_230020428":"A gentle breeze appears beneath my feet. I float up, and Elune looks at me with a smile.","text_story_230020429":"I hold her delicate waist, mimicking the dance moves of the people below.","text_story_230020430":"Elune spins, stretches, and dances, holding my hand, joyful like a newly hatched bird.","text_story_230020431":"We cooperate seamlessly, as if we had rehearsed a thousand times. I hold her waist, ending the dance with the final spin.","text_story_230020432":"Omniguardian, I'm truly happy to be with you like this.","text_story_230020433":"Karinya taught me to soar and be free, and you gave me strength. Under your guidance, I became the \"Valor Valkyrie.\"","text_story_230020434":"It's also the result of your efforts.","text_story_230020435":"But undeniably, you are still an important person to me.","text_story_230020436":"The Abyss Seal is near the Dreamwoods. Omniguardian, can I go with you?","text_story_230020437":"Okay.","text_story_230020438":"Then it's a deal!","text_story_230020501":"The Abyss Seal is just ahead. Within two or three miles of the seal is the Misty Forest, the territory of the Forest Temple.","text_story_230020502":"When the Abyss invaded years ago, it corrupted the nearby forest. We had to designate this area as a buffer zone.","text_story_230020503":"While speaking, a giant spider descends, hissing and lunging towards Elune.","text_story_230020504":"Two beams of light flash, and both Elune and I make a move. The unfortunate spider is instantly knocked away by the two forces.","text_story_230020505":"Omniguardian, look out!","text_story_230020506":"Watch out!","text_story_230020507":"Are you okay?","text_story_230020508":"My palm is against the girl's arm, her skin crystal clear, and her feathers soft.","text_story_230020509":"I'm fine... I appreciate your concern.","text_story_230020510":"As you can see, many creatures in this forest have been corrupted by the Abyss, leading to mutations.","text_story_230020511":"Fortunately, we ultimately held the line in the Dreamwoods. Omniguardian, this is also thanks to you.","text_story_230020512":"Although I don't remember it,","text_story_230020513":"I still sincerely feel happy for you.","text_story_230020514":"At that time, I thought, even if I die here, I must not let the Abyss take another step forward.","text_story_230020515":"Because Karinya is slumbering in our hometown. I can't let these filthy creatures disturb her.","text_story_230020516":"And it's not just Karinya; there are other people and our shared home—the forest.","text_story_230020517":"Perhaps it's for them that I have been fighting until now.","text_story_230020518":"You're a true \"Valor Valkyrie.\"","text_story_230020519":"That's the meaning of \"valor.\"","text_story_230020520":"Omniguardian, I haven't let down your expectations. It's really great.","text_story_230020521":"Perhaps it's because of your expectations that I have the courage to overcome difficulties time and time again.","text_story_230020522":"Looking at Elune like this, I can't help but ruffle her hair—softer than I imagined.","text_story_230020523":"This is the result of your own efforts.","text_story_230020524":"Elune suddenly smiles. She stands obediently in place, letting me mess up her hair.","text_story_230020525":"Omniguardian... Thank you for always standing by my side.","text_story_230020526":"Whenever I needed you, I could always find you.","text_story_230020527":"Always be protected by you.","text_story_230020528":"Karinya taught me what freedom is, and you gave me strength and emotion.","text_story_230020529":"I also want to do something for you...","text_story_230020530":"Like, besides protecting the forest, I want to... protect you.","text_story_230020531":"Elune is a bit shy, but she still looks at me firmly, without averting her gaze.","text_story_230020532":"Of course, you can.","text_story_230020533":"It's my honor, Valkyrie.","text_story_230020601":"When the matters of this journey are completed, it's already several days later. And during this time, Elune has been with me.","text_story_230020602":"Omniguardian... Are you going back to Mirlond tomorrow?","text_story_230020603":"Yes.","text_story_230020604":"Then... tonight, can you accompany me to a place? A place just for the two of us.","text_story_230020605":"Sure.","text_story_230020606":"Elune happily wants to give me a hug. But she is too shy, just lightly using her wings to wrap me.","text_story_230020607":"Her feathers are soft and warm, timidly touching me, causing a tickling sensation in my heart.","text_story_230020608":"Let's go to the tallest tree in the forest!","text_story_230020609":"Elune takes me to the observation platform on the top of the tree. After that, she said she needed to prepare something and asked me to wait for a moment.","text_story_230020610":"Omniguardian... Do I look pretty like this?","text_story_230020611":"Ding dong! A crisp sound echoes in the wind. I look up and see the girl landing in front of me.","text_story_230020612":"This is the dress prepared by the Verdians for the Valkyries... but it's my first time wearing it, so I don't know how it looks.","text_story_230020613":"It looks great.","text_story_230020614":"As long as you like it.","text_story_230020615":"Elune sits beside me, the feathers at the tip of her wings covering my hand, discreetly hooking onto my fingertips.","text_story_230020616":"Have you seen the glow in the forest sea?","text_story_230020617":"That's actually a group of glowing birds. The way they fly together, doesn't it look like the Milky Way?","text_story_230020618":"Yes.","text_story_230020619":"These birds are called Glowbirds and only appear in peacetime. Among the forest people, they symbolize peace and happiness.","text_story_230020620":"If we hadn't repelled the Abyss, maybe they would never have appeared again.","text_story_230020621":"Omniguardian, this is a gift for you. I hope this night becomes a special memory for you.","text_story_230020622":"It's beautiful. Thank you.","text_story_230020623":"Well then, at the end of the night, would you like to dance with me?","text_story_230020624":"Sure.","text_story_230020625":"I step into the wind, placing my hands on her shoulders and waist, as if holding a delicate little bird.","text_story_230020626":"In matters of emotion, Elune is inexperienced and tender. She is a bit nervous but still trusts me enough to lead the dance.","text_story_230020627":"Supporting her waist, we twirl and dance. Her warm body temperature radiates through my palms, warming my heart.","text_story_230020628":"Our hearts connect, our skin touches, and our breaths intertwine. Her long hair brushes against my face, evoking a subtle flirtatious sense.","text_story_230020629":"The long tail feathers of the dress dance in the air, resembling a rose transitioning from youth to maturity, ultimately blooming to reveal a tender pistil.","text_story_230020630":"Omniguardian... How do you feel?","text_story_230020631":"I feel amazing.","text_story_230020632":"It's strange but I really like it.","text_story_230020633":"After all, I've prepared for so long...","text_story_230020634":"For me?","text_story_230020635":"Yes... For you, and only for you.","text_story_230020636":"I've fantasized about this day for a long time... But now that the day has finally come, I still feel a bit overwhelmed.","text_story_230020637":"You're doing great.","text_story_230020638":"I'll take it from here.","text_story_230020639":"Then, I entrust myself to you, dear Omniguardian.","text_story_230020640":"This will surely be a beautiful and unforgettable night.","title_elite_10001":"Bastet Biography 1","title_elite_10002":"Bastet Biography 2","title_elite_10003":"Bastet Biography 3","title_elite_10004":"Interactive Story 1","title_elite_10005":"Interactive Story 2","title_elite_10006":"Interactive Story 3","hero_name_1027":"Bastet","text_treat_100070101":"Omniguardian, you've arrived.","text_treat_100070102":"How are you feeling?","text_treat_100070103":"Your injuries seem quite severe.","text_treat_100070104":"Don't worry, I have this little one keeping me company.","text_treat_100070105":"(The black cat gently licks Bastet's wounds, and she can't help but show a pained expression.)","text_treat_100070106":"I'm sorry for the rare reunion, yet you see me in such a state...","text_treat_100070107":"When it hurts, there's no need to endure.","text_treat_100070108":"You are still as gentle as before, truly nostalgic.","text_treat_100070109":"Before...","text_treat_100070110":"No need to rush, we can slowly recall the past.","text_treat_100080101":"Mm-hmm...

Quite disappointing, turns out it's not because you wanted to see me early.","text_treat_100090105":"Uhmm... Sorry?","text_treat_100090106":"Hehe, you're still as honest as ever.","text_treat_100090107":"Next treatment, my injuries should be fully healed.","text_treat_100090108":"I look forward to that day, Omniguardian.","text_treat_100100101":"(Walking into the room, you find Bastet still lying on the bed, but her condition has improved.)","text_treat_100100102":"(If in the past it was enduring pain, now it's more like an utterly defenseless cat, lazy and leisurely.)","text_treat_100100103":"Come, Omniguardian, this is the last treatment.","text_treat_100100104":"I rarely wake up early, only because you're here.","text_treat_100100105":"(You examine Bastet's injuries. She stretches her limbs, making a comfortable and kitten-like purring sound.)","text_treat_100100106":"Feeling better?","text_treat_100100107":"Mm-hmm, my body hasn't felt this light in a long time, thanks to your treatment.","text_treat_100100108":"(The black cat in Bastet's arms relaxes around you, curiously circling.)","text_treat_100100109":"It's not easy to get a cat to open its heart.

Let's save some topics for our next meeting.","text_treat_100100113":"Hope to see you again soon, Omniguardian.","text_story_100040101":"(After healing, Bastet returned to the Valkyrie Temple, and I decided to visit her.)","text_story_100040102":"(The temple is unexpectedly luxurious.

Therefore, Bastet developed an independent personality early on, sometimes hiding in a corner of the street, sometimes lurking among the crowd, changing her shelter daily, and searching for the next meal to fill her stomach. Fortunately, she had a natural affinity with cats and could exchange information with stray cats about food and warm places. Although the days of wandering were tumultuous, they were still somewhat interesting.\n\nOne day, a familiar black cat, Milo, brought good news: there was a place where free food would appear regularly. Bastet followed Milo to a street corner, squatting curiously on the side. Her head followed the meandering cats around until a surprised voice came from above: \"Oh? Did you bring friends over?\"\n\nAnd that's how Bastet met Sasha from the Catkin Tribe.\n\nThe Catkin Tribe, located at the border between the Woodland and the Empire, often conflicts with humans. Therefore, they are somewhat skeptical of humans. Bastet's human appearance initially didn't easily gain the tribe's trust. Fortunately, as the leader, Sasha went against the tide and insisted on sheltering Bastet and Milo.\n\nNevertheless, years of estrangement won't easily disappear. To help Bastet integrate into tribal life, Sasha deliberately prepared a pair of cat ear-like headgear. Not wanting to trouble the kind-hearted Catkins, Bastet started wearing the headgear daily, and thus, one human and one cat settled in the tribe.","text_elite_10002":"Perhaps recognizing Bastet's efforts to integrate into the tribe, the Catkin gradually accepted her and Milo's presence. Unfortunately, the peaceful days did not last long.\n\nWith the sudden appearance of Abyssal creatures, the entire Palmarius continent was caught off guard. When the Abyss invaded the Catkin tribe's territory, Sasha naturally led the defense at the forefront. Facing the fierce Abyss army, Sasha and her warriors chose to bravely resist. However, the elves, accustomed to facing only human bandits, were powerless against the unknown and exceptionally powerful monsters.\n\nWitnessing Sasha fall under the monster's fangs, Bastet felt an uncontrollable power erupting within her, and she lost consciousness. Upon awakening, Milo was licking her face repeatedly. Bastet struggled to sit up, and to her surprise, the Abyss monsters that had attacked were now scattered lifeless around her. She was unharmed.\n\nThe tribe buried Sasha and the fallen comrades, then hailed Bastet as a deity: 'Please use that mysterious and great power to fend off monsters and protect the tribe.' However, Bastet had no idea where the eruptive power came from or how to respond to the expectations of the Catkin. So, one night, exhausted in body and mind, Bastet, accompanied by the headgear Sasha gave her and Milo, left the tribe and embarked on a new journey of wandering.","text_elite_10003":"In the end, the Eclipsers, composed of hybrids and rejects, accepted Bastet's return to a wandering life. In this loosely organized council, Bastet could turn a deaf ear to the outside world, play with cats when awake, and sleep when tired. Occasionally hearing about the Omniguardians and their followers fighting against the Abyss, Bastet would pat Milo's head and say, 'That's not something we need to worry about, right, Milo?'\n\nUntil one day, the Omniguardian visited the Eclipsers and brought bad news: the Abyss forces were becoming more rampant, several settlements were severely damaged, and some were almost wiped out, including the Catkin tribe. Upon hearing this news, Bastet realized that she had abandoned them when the elves needed her the most. Unable to protect the tribe that had once felt like home, Bastet fell into deep regret.\n\nSensing her emotional turmoil, the Omniguardian identified the mysterious power within her, originating from the Itheron. It turned out that Bastet's body carried the bloodline of a half-goddess. The Omniguardian told Bastet that the blessing of the Fire Ring's Oath could help her fully control the semi-divine power within, on the condition that she needed to become a Valkyrie and maintain peace in the Eclipsers region.\n\nAfter much contemplation, Bastet agreed to the Omniguardian's proposal. In the warm glow of the Fire Ring's blessing, she felt a certain uneasy energy within her suddenly calming down. The moment the oath was completed, Bastet understood that she had fully mastered the power within her, though she still didn't know its name.\n\nFrom then on, the wandering stray cat took on the title of the Mystic Valkyrie, doing her best to protect those she could still safeguard.","text_story_200070101":"Accepted Dorabella's outing invitation.

How does it feel?","text_story_200070139":"Hmm, not bad.","text_story_200070140":"Dorabella looked at you and suddenly burst into laughter.

I didn't expect you to say the same things as before, even though you don't remember anything.","text_story_200080126":"She blinked and then, as if changing her expression like a mask, her face suddenly became mischievous.","text_story_200080127":"Consistent as always, Omniguardian... You truly have my admiration.","text_story_200080128":"And, coincidentally, like you, I have confidence in myself.","text_story_200080129":"For the Ethereal Valkyrie, to control the Ethereal power is, of course, the most basic thing.","text_story_200080130":"Realizing she had just made a deliberate joke, you smiled helplessly.","text_story_200080131":"Alright, it's time to get to work.","text_story_200080132":"Before it gets dark, let's plant these magical plants together!","text_story_200080133":"The sunlight filtering through the branches of the forest happened to shine on Dorabella's face; she blinked once again.","text_story_200080134":"I know you also enjoy partnering with me, don't you?","text_story_200090101":"(Looking up at the castle entwined with black iron vines)","text_story_200090102":"(Reaching out to knock on the door, the large door emitting the scent of elderberry suddenly opened by itself.)","text_story_200090103":"In the somewhat dim castle, behind various floating porcelain cups, you saw a familiar face.","text_story_200090104":"(Laughing lightly) Look who's here?","text_story_200090105":"Indeed, the all-powerful Omniguardian, this castle is challenging to find.","text_story_200090106":"Exactly!

After a moment, she spoke.)","text_story_110060104":"Then, we have to purify them; otherwise, they will attack nearby villages, causing greater casualties.","text_story_110060105":"This place is close to the abyss, and its power is enhanced; these polluted people are no different from high-level monsters.","text_story_110060106":"Then let's do it together.","text_story_110060107":"No, let me handle this myself. This is my responsibility and my past that I must face.","text_story_110060108":"I have an idea; wait for me.","text_story_110060109":"(Arkidina quickly disappeared, and moments later reappeared before me.)","text_story_110060110":"This is my garb as the Vengeance Valkyrie; I only wear it when proclaiming my faith.","text_story_110060111":"These people once worshiped me, and this attire should help put them at ease.","text_story_110060112":"I hope to minimize their suffering… and purify their souls as quickly as possible.","text_story_110060113":"Then, I'm going.","text_story_110060114":"(Arkidina walked towards the village. The polluted people did not attack her; instead, they followed her mindlessly.)","text_story_110060115":"(A crowd gathered behind Arkidina, like a saint leading a pilgrimage.)","text_story_110060116":"(The people followed their goddess of faith to the only temple in the village, the temple of the Vengeance Valkyrie.)","text_story_110060117":"(The abandoned temple, overgrown with weeds, was suddenly illuminated by flames that appeared out of nowhere.)","text_story_110060118":"It was because I was tainted by the abyss that led you to be eroded.","text_story_110060119":"Therefore, today, I come to bear my sin and free your souls.","text_story_110060120":"Your will will be with me; it will become a part of me.","text_story_110060121":"(The flames ignited, the temple collapsed, and Arkidina's skirt was scorched, but she didn't mind.)","text_story_110060122":"I will take part of you with me to take revenge on the abyss!

How long do you intend to keep me here?","text_treat_110070105":"Until the Abyssal corruption subsides,","text_treat_110070106":"Then I will release you.","text_treat_110070107":"I betrayed you. Why not just kill me instead?","text_treat_110070108":"I need your strength.","text_treat_110070109":"You still have a chance for redemption.","text_treat_110070110":"Redemption... like you did on the atonement day?","text_treat_110070111":"(Arkdina brushed her cheek with her hand, letting out a mocking laugh.)","text_treat_110070112":"Because of your decision, I lost my Omniguardian that day.","text_treat_110070113":"I have no regrets. Everything I did was to bring back the true Omniguardian, the real you.","text_treat_110070114":"So here I am.","text_treat_110070115":"Thank you for choosing me.","text_treat_110070117":"You didn't come here just to say that, did you?","text_treat_110070118":"Since we're removing the Abyssal corruption, let's do it quickly. These chains won't hold me for long.","text_treat_110070119":"Ugh...","text_treat_110070120":"Does it hurt?","text_treat_110070121":"Compared to the Abyssal corruption, this pain is nothing.","text_treat_110070122":"Did you hurt on the atonement day?","text_treat_110070123":"...","text_treat_110070124":"I don't remember.","text_treat_110070125":"...You can leave.","text_treat_110070126":"Don't forget the next healing session; I don't want to stay in this prison forever.","text_treat_110080101":"Seems like even after losing your memory, your punctuality hasn't changed.","text_treat_110080102":"I've been thinking about you.","text_treat_110080103":"Naturally, I came right on time.","text_treat_110080104":"...Hmph, you've become more slippery with your words.","text_treat_110080105":"The pain is subsiding...","text_treat_110080106":"This is the power of the divine hand.
