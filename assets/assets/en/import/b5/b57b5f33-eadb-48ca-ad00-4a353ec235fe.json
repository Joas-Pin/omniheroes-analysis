Eventually, he was brutally killed.\n\nHis devotion touched the Mother Goddess and she summoned and revived him as a Divine, allowing him to continue with his mission.\n\nAlthough the Mother Goddess has passed on, Aneklet keeps his faith and continues helping the sincere devotees as he hopes that her light can once again shine upon the world...\n\n","hero_bio_51990":"Coming soon!","hero_bio_53991":"The depths of the Infinite Abyss is a world that is beyond the imaginations of mere mortals. It is filled with chaos and death and is governed by no rules. Most creatures of the Abyss know only the language of slaughter and only the fiercest hunters among them earn the right to survive. It is here that the individual feared by many an Abyssal creature dwells-Yella.\n\nYella is a high-level demon, rarely seen in the Abyss. Her combat style is fiercer than the most primitive of beasts, wielding the dual-edged scythe she calls the Hammer Crusher. (No one knows why she gave it such a strange name.) She wanders every corner of the Abyss, tirelessly searching for any opponent who can put up a fight.\n\nBefore she fell into the Abyss and became a demon, Yella was a convicted murderer in ancient times. She was mentally disturbed and addicted to acts of murder. She committed dozens of heinous murders for her own amusement and was thus deprived of her right to live.\n\nWhat awaited Yella was not a hanging nor a cruel execution, the wardens secretly whisked her away to an unknown location where she became the first live specimen of a mysterious ritual.\n\nThe researchers bound Yella to an altar and infused her body with strange magical energy. The magic possessed destructive traits and wantonly destroyed and restructured every inch of muscle, arteries, and bones in her body. Yella's body underwent a rapid transformation, shifting from a solid form to a near-spirit-like form before slowly returning to solid form and shifting into a spirit form again. This went on for many cycles until the transformations stopped and she remained in solid form.\n\nIt was not the result the researchers expected so they deemed the experiment a failure.\n\nThey threw Yella into a cell in the deepest reaches where the walls were carved with powerful sealing runes to prevent anyone from escaping. She was then forgotten and left to fend for herself.\n\nShe stayed in that dark prison cell for what seemed an eternity... Yet, Yella lived on. That strange magic continued to transform her, granting her vitality which far exceeded that of a mere mortal. However, this vitality came at a cruel price-her body no longer looked human and she lost most of her senses. She could no longer distinguish colors, had no sense of smell, and could not feel warmth or pain. Her heart was slowly taken over by confusion and brutality.\n\nMore time passed before a hapless young man stumbled into the prison and accidentally opened the door to her cell. That was the day Yella saw daylight once more.\n\nThe man must have been one of the researchers. He was frantic as he ran into the cell as if fleeing from something, unaware of who awaited in the dark. Yella expressed her gratitude to him by snapping his neck and basking in his warm blood-a celebration of her freedom.\n\nYella made her way outside, intent on killing every individual who imprisoned her here, but all she found were a pile of corpses on the floor. Someone had beaten her to it.\n\nUnable to find the one who got her into this mess nor anyone who appeared to be alive, Yella burned the research lab to the ground in a rage then set her sights on a village in the distance.\n\nYella had forgotten how long it had been since she's last killed someone. That twisted yearning in her heart had tormented her for far too long. She needed an outlet. Now.\n\nThe innocent villagers didn't know what hit them, but Yella was still on the brink of madness. The strange magic energy was preventing her from feeling even the slightest stir in her heart.\n\nYella refused to give up, so she moved on to a second village... And a third...\n\nHer brutal actions quickly drew the attention of the Divine and Xiana, a female Divine charged with punishing evil, descended to dole out judgment upon Yella. Unaware of Yella's past, Xiana greatly underestimated her opponent and was shocked by Yella's abnormal strength in the ensuing battle.\n\nThe battle ended in a draw. Yella may have shattered Xiana's weapon but she herself was badly injured. She lay in a pool of her own blood, covered in alarming wounds and a look of eerie excitement on her face.\n\nThat clash of equals allowed her to feel that addictive pleasure she hadn't felt for so long.\n\nYella shifted focus from then on, she began to wander in search of her equal. It was during this time that a war of unprecedented scale broke out in Delfachet. Under the guidance of the Goddess of Darkness, humans were sounding the horn to attack the God of Light.\n\nThat was how Yella discovered where to go-the Seraphic Court and the primary battlefield of the great war, where the most powerful have all gathered.\n\nYella had them in her sights.\n\nShe had no intention of helping either side and so a bizarre sight quickly reared its head at the Seraphic Court. A monstrous-looking and deranged woman smashing the head of a human warrior before swiftly digging her claws into the chest of a Divine.\n\nPerhaps it was fate that dictated the reunion. Yella met the same female Divine on the battlefield wielding a new hammer. It seemed quite different from the old one but Yella paid it no mind.\n\nXiana had also spotted Yella in the chaos. Yella grinned and charged at her.\n\nAnother fierce battle erupted between them but the outcome was drastically different from their first. Xiana's new weapon was blessed by the God of Light and Yella had trouble warding off each hefty swing. In the end, Xiana knocked Yella off the Seraphic Court with one mighty swing, sending her falling into the Infinite Abyss...\n\nIt took a long time for Yella to regain consciousness in the Abyss. She was still alive and surrounded by a world of darkness and dead silence. Nothing stirred in her heart, however. This was just another hunting ground. Her mind was filled with the image of Xiana and the thirst for another round of battle with her.\n\n\"I'll defeat you this time, Xiana. Just you wait,\" Yella grinned as she muttered to herself.\n\nBut before that, she needed to find a new weapon...","hero_bio_52992":"Various groaning and crying noises reverberated throughout the dark dungeon.\n\nThis was a dungeon owned by the demons and it was also Lady Aiushtha's playground. She loved torturing the human heroes and high-ranking Divine judges here.\n\nThe more devoted they were, the more Lady Aiushtha enjoyed torturing them. She loved seeing them give up their cause and cooperate with the demons. Aiushtha experienced elation every time someone's willpower broke.\n\nAnd this was where Lance was born.\n\nLance was the Lady's favorite tool of torture, a candelabra used for torturing.\n\nMaybe it was because he absorbed too much of the resentment and desire of his targets, Lance gained his own sentience. Aiushtha discovered this very quickly and began to infuse this candelabra made from bone with large amounts of Divine and human blood, allowing him his fill of blood in the dark dungeon.\n\nAfter a long time of being infused with blood, the curse transformed and Lance finally became a demon.\n\nPerhaps due to the fact that he was once a torture tool, the cold Lance still tortures those that become his enemy, his ruthless flames his best tool of torture.\n\n","hero_tip_0":"Hero Tips","hero_tip_13001":"<color=#ffd060>Justice Warrior—Themis</color>\nSkilled at killing single targets and then pursuing remaining enemies.\n<color=#a62e2e>Target: Frontline</color>","hero_tip_14002":"<color=#ffd060>Moira of Demise—Atropos</color>\nFocuses on enhancing the ally hero with the highest ATK.

It is a form she has taken in memory of a mortal whom she respects deeply.\n\nAtalanta is a god worshiped by the Nozens, a group of pious and brave mortals whose lineage, under Atalanta's protection, had been passed down peacefully for several centuries.\n\nIt was an annual tradition for the Nozens to hold a challenge to ascend the sky-piercing Komir Peak. At the summit, they made offerings to their goddess and prayed for her blessings.\n\nOne time, Atalanta noticed a girl named Nifsoel who scaled the mountain with many others. She was far behind the others every year, yet she always gritted her teeth and persevered through the climb, albeit failing to reach the summit on most occasions. But that was the only impression Atalanta had of her, because her gaze would always be drawn to other youths who were stronger and had more potential.\n\nSeveral years later, an incident happened that changed everything. Atalanta sensed someone calling to her from the mortal realm, but when she responded and looked for them, she found Nifsoel by herself at the foot of Komir Peak covered in horrifying wounds.\n\nAn army of Barbarians from the border had invaded the defenseless and unprepared Nozens with little to no warning. Nifsoel fought desperately to get out of their encirclement and approached Atalanta for help. She willingly offered her body as a vessel for divine power to save her suffering tribesmen.\n\nBut Atalanta still ended up rejecting Nifsoel's plea. She did not believe that the girl had what it took to be a great warrior. Nifsoel was too frail and petite and belonged behind frontline warriors under their protection, not fighting alongside them.\n\nAs her desperate pleas bore no results, the dejected and badly wounded Nifsoel limped away from Komir Peak.\n\nTo aid her followers in repelling the invaders, Atalanta projected a clone of herself and headed for the battlefield. However, Atalanta noticed something amiss during the battle. Though the Barbarian army before her was unusually fierce, they did not seem to press their attack...\n\nNews came quickly confirming her suspicions; the evacuating Nozans were ambushed from the rear. Atalanta transformed into a beam of light and rushed over to the Nozan camp, which had been burned to the ground. There, she saw Nifsoel once again. Half-covered in blood, Nifsoel was kneeling on the ground and supporting herself with a tightly-gripped, broken longsword.\n\nNifsoel had held out till the very end. To buy time for her tribesmen to evacuate, the courageous girl took it upon herself to hold back the Barbarian army, even at the cost of her life.\n\nHaving witnessed Nifsoel's sacrifice, Atalanta fell silent. After a moment, she projected her consciousness into Nifsoel's dying body to prolong her life.\n\nAtalanta began searching for the mastermind who incited the war. She ultimately located the demon Daksys, a merciless and bloodthirsty executioner. Those savage Barbarians were merely wretched souls compelled to war by him.\n\nDuring her campaign, Atalanta was ambushed by Daksys. Injured, she was forced into a fierce battle with him and his army. Despite her fighting with all her might and slaying most of them, by the time she came face to face with Daksys, Atalanta's divine powers were nearly exhausted.\n\nDaksys strode over to Atalanta with a malicious smirk on his face, as if he was taunting a doomed prey. Just as Daksys was about to claw out Atalanta's heart, a mysterious burst of power suddenly came from her severely weakened body. Atalanta was astonished when she realized it was from the mortal girl whom she had overlooked all this time.\n\nWith all her strength, Atalanta drew her bow and fired an arrow whose tip glowed with the radiant power of the mortal. The arrow flew across the air with a ring that reached the heavens. Daksys' face froze in utter shock as the arrow struck and disintegrated his flesh, which melted like that of snow...\n\nNifsoel's body likewise crumbled away when the arrow left the bow. However, the memory of her strength and courage would remain in Atalanta's heart for eternity. Since the battle, Atalanta changed her appearance to look like Nifsoel in honor of the mortal who had left such a deep impact on her.\n\n","hero_name_43006":"Vittoria","hero_title_43006":"Winged Victory","hero_name_53006":"Macaria","hero_title_53006":"Abyss Queen","hero_bio_53006":"Macaria is a rare high-ranking demon in the Demonic Realm, but her fighting style is more brutal than the most primitive demons, driven by her instinct as a demon and fueled by her hatred for the Omniguardian.\n\nIn the flourishing era of sentient beings thousands of years ago, Macaria, who purely sought combat and power, was attracted by the mighty Omniguardian. With her outstanding combat prowess, she joined the ranks of the Omniguardian and became one of the Royals, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the divines.\n\nHowever, Macaria's ruthless way of fighting drew the displeasure of the divine Vittoria.\n\nIn an open duel proposed by Vittoria, Macaria suffered defeat. Watching Vittoria celebrating her victory with her back turned, jealousy and instinct prompted Macaria to launch a surprise attack. However, the Omniguardian detected her actions and punished her, leading to her fall into the Demonic Realm.\n\nDisappointed by the Omniguardian, Macaria became disgusted by the hypocritical divines. Only in the Demonic Realm, a place filled with slaughter and evil, could she reveal her true nature. No! A powerful being like her shouldn't be subservient here. She intends to make the whole world kneel before her rules!\n\nTo achieve this goal, the first step is to eliminate the troublesome Mastema and ascend to the throne atop the Demonic Realm.","hero_bio_43006":"In the dim beginning of the Fire Ring's Oath, a protracted and devastating conflict erupted between the Divine and the Demon in a bid for limited resources, famously known as the Twin Catastrophes.\n\nThe stalemate led to widespread suffering and devastation until a Divine girl unexpectedly slew the leader of the Demons. The scales of victory finally tipped, and the leaderless Demons chose to retreat into the boundless realm of darkness, easing the situation.\n\nTo commemorating the courageous act of the Divine girl, she was honored with the name of victory, Vittoria.\n\nVittoria's sword pointed directly at the evil enemy forces, her momentum as grand as an epic tale. In the years that followed, wherever the girl traversed became a place where triumphal songs echoed. Many witnessed her exposing the true face of the fallen Demon, Macaria, and banishing her from the ranks of the Royals.\n\nHowever, as time passed, war persisted, and more names familiar to Vittoria vanished into the tumultuous history of conflict. She finally realized that a simple victory held no meaning; the war would not bring peace but rather lead to tragedy.\n\nIn the new era marked by the fall of deities and the loss of faith, how could this world, battered and scarred, be reshaped? Contemplating this question led Vittoria onto the path of seeking answers.","hero_tip_43006":"<color=#ffd060>Winged Victory Vittoria</color>\nCapable of dealing high AoE damage and granting Shields to allies when they kill enemies.","hero_tip_53006":"<color=#ffd060>Abyss Queen—Macaria</color>\nDeals extra damage to damage-reduced enemies.

Witnessing this mysterious force, the elves hailed Bastet as a deity, hoping to receive her protection in the chaotic world. However, she had no idea where that eruptive power came from. Faced with prayers she couldn't answer, Bastet chose to leave and eventually wandered to the Eclipsers with her companion, Milo.\n\nLiving a carefree life at the Eclipsers, Bastet played with cats when awake and slept endlessly when tired. Her tranquil existence was disrupted when the Omniguardian brought news of the Catkin tribe's destruction by the Abyss. Bastet regretted not staying behind to protect her tribe.

She believed that within this unknown realm lay a tremendous power capable of overturning traditional magic. Thus, she embarked on a journey to explore the secrets of Void magic, conducting a series of experiments and research.\n\nYet, delving into forbidden territory always comes with unpredictable risks.
