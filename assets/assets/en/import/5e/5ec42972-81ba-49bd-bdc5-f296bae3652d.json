I hope that you can leave <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color> as soon as possible.","dungeon_100000_1_4":"No sister! I won't leave you behind!

As the General of the Empire, I command you to leave <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color> and go as far away as possible!","dungeon_100000_1_6":"Alright, <color=#c05100>General Elude</color>, if that's your order...","dungeon_100000_1_7_1":"Don't even try taking another step forward, you wretched demons!

Please let me know your identity.","dungeon_100000_1_9":"I am the <color=#c05100>Omniguardian Helos</color>. I have come here under the <color=#c05100>Creator's</color> instruction.","dungeon_100000_1_10":"Omniguardian? I heard rumors from the Empires mages before.

I have to find the <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color> within the city as soon as possible. Only with the mighty strength of the Valkyrie can we defeat the <color=#c05100>Demon</color>!","dungeon_100000_2_1":"<color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>, have you chosen to side with the mortals and stand against the demons? You must be sick of living!","dungeon_100000_2_2":"<color=#c05100>Arkdina</color>! Under Eve, the <color=#c05100>Creator</color>'s, guidance, you and your demon army are bound for destruction.","dungeon_100000_2_3":"Don't act so tough. Without the <color=#c05100>Valkyries</color>, you are no different from any other powerless mortal.","dungeon_100000_2_4":"Filth like you and your friends are not worth my time. There are more important matters that require my attention. Why don't you become food for my <color=#c05100>demon army</color> instead?","dungeon_100000_3_1":"<color=#c05100>Arkdina</color>……That Demon queen... She must be plotting some frightening plan against the Empire.","dungeon_100000_3_2":"The danger surrounding <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color> has not been dealt with. I have to stop her. She cannot be allowed to escape that easily!","dungeon_100000_3_3":"...Time is ticking.

We have to find the <color=#c05100>Valkyries</color> before it completely destroys this place!","dungeon_101002_1_1":"There's a reaction from the <color=#c05100>Creator's Omniseal</color>! It seems like the <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color> is nearby.","dungeon_101002_1_2":"Don't block my way! I have to go and support <color=#c05100>General Elude</color>! I can't let her face the <color=#c05100>Demonic Leader</color> alone!","dungeon_101002_1_3":"Valkyrie! I'll fight alongside you!","dungeon_101002_1_4":"You've arrived just in time! I'm <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie Eluller</color>. Let's eliminate these wretched Demons!","dungeon_101002_2_1":"Thank you, Odysseus. You came at the right time.","dungeon_101002_2_2":"<color=#ffa352>Valkyrie Arkdina</color> has defected to the Demons! We must defeat her immediately!","dungeon_101002_2_3":"Then let's hurry!","dungeon_101002_2_4":"Please, make a Valkyrie Pact with me, Eluller. Join me in the duty of saving the world.","dungeon_101002_2_5":"Pact? Duty? Hmph, sounds like trouble to me.","dungeon_101002_2_6":"Compared to becoming a Valkyrie, I'd rather wipe out these vile demons and save the city first.","dungeon_101002_2_7":"But if you promise to help... I'll give the pact some serious thought.","dungeon_101002_2_8":"Very well, we have an agreement. Punishing evildoers and vanquishing demons are part of the Omniguardian's duties after all.","dungeon_101002_2_9":"Now, let us fight alongside each other to save <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color>!","dungeon_101003_1_1":"Do-don't come any closer!","dungeon_101003_1_2":"Listen here, I'm a <color=#ffa352>Woodland Priestess</color>... I'm quite p-powerful!","dungeon_101003_1_3":"Fear not, young lady. Here comes the Valkyrie!","dungeon_101003_1_5":"Spirits of Nature, grant me the power of healing!","dungeon_101003_1_6":"Thank you Heroes! The prophecy of the forest sprits were indeed accurate! The <color=#c05100>Omniguardian and Valkyrie</color> has indeed appeared before me!","dungeon_101003_1_7":"However, I'm afraid that you might be a little late. When I was trapped, I heard the Demonic Leader <color=#c05100>Arkdina</color> is heading towards the <color=#c05100>Empire Sanctuary</color>.","dungeon_101003_1_8":"Arkdina wants to hold a <color=#c05100>blood ritual</color> at the Sanctuary to corrupt the entire <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color>. At that time, all living creatures will perish.","dungeon_101003_1_9":"What an evil plan... No wonder Arkdina left first. She must have went to the <color=#c05100>Empire Sanctuary</color> to prepare for the ritual.","dungeon_101003_1_10":"Damn! We have to hurry to the <color=#c05100>Empire Sanctuary</color> and stop Arkdina!","dungeon_101003_1_11":"Come with me! The <color=#c05100>Empire Sanctuary</color> is just ahead!","dungeon_101004_1_1":"I'll tear you limb from limb, Valkyrie!","dungeon_101004_1_2":"Hah, show me what you've got, big guy!","dungeon_101004_2_1":"No! I won't fail! Burn from the Abyssal Flames!!!","dungeon_101004_2_2":"Meet your end, <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color>!","dungeon_101005_1_1":"It self-destructed?! Is everyone alright?","dungeon_101005_1_2":"(Cough, cough...) I-I'm alright...","dungeon_101005_1_3":"I sense the traitor <color=#ffa352>Arkdina</color> is right ahead.","dungeon_101005_1_4":"Hurry up. The fight that will determine the Empire's fate is upon us!","dungeon_101005_1_5":"The Demonic Leader is waiting for us over there. Let's hurry. The fight that will determine the fate of the Empire is upon us!","dungeon_101006_2_1":"<color=#ffa352>Arkdina</color>, let's end this right here, right now!","dungeon_101006_2_2":"Eluller, resistance is futile. Submit yourself to darkness and destruction!","dungeon_101006_2_3":"In your dreams! The Valkyries will never surrender to evil!","dungeon_101006_3_1":"Stop, you cursed demon! I won't let you have your way!","dungeon_101006_3_2":"<color=#c05100>Eluller</color>...? What are you doing here in the Empire Sanctuary? Listen to me, you have to leave!","dungeon_101006_3_3":"No, I won't! I'm not doing as you say this time, Elude.","dungeon_101006_3_4":"I know you're trying to protect me, but you should know very well that I will never leave you behind!","dungeon_101006_3_5":"Eluller...","dungeon_101006_3_6":"I see. In that case, let us unite our efforts and face the Demonic Leader as one this time to save <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color>.","dungeon_101006_3_7":"My, what a moving reunion... Unfortunately, this tiresome sister drama ends now.","dungeon_101006_3_8":"A <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color> without a pact is powerless before me. Prepare to sink into the deepest throes of despair!","dungeon_101006_4_1":"It's over! We defeated Arkdina!","dungeon_101006_4_2":"This is…!","dungeon_101006_4_3":"Arkdina has revealed her true form! Argh, I can barely breathe...","dungeon_101007_1_1":"Such a frightening sense of oppression... The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> has rejuvenated the enemy!","dungeon_101007_2_1":"Arkdina is too powerful... We may not be able to hold on much longer!","dungeon_101007_2_2":"I... can still fight! I will never give in! <color=#ffa352>Valkyric Power</color>, awaken!","dungeon_101007_2_3":"I... can still fight! I will never give in!","dungeon_101007_2_4":"Stand back, <color=#c05100>Eluller</color>! I shall protect all of you!","dungeon_101007_2_6":"Sister, no!!!","dungeon_101007_2_7":"<color=#ffa352>Arkdina</color>! Now, face a <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color>'s wrath!","dungeon_101007_3_1":"We won! <color=#ffa352>Arkdina</color>, your evil powers cannot compete with the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color>!","dungeon_101007_3_2":"Odysseus, my body... has reached its limit. (Eluller falls to her knees feebly.)","dungeon_101007_3_3":"Hang in there. I'm taking you home!","dungeon_101007_3_4":"<color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>, do you know why?","dungeon_101007_3_5":"When the Pact of Darkness appeared, I sensed a connection between its dark power and the Valkyric Power.","dungeon_101007_3_6":"It may just be the key to averting this apocalypse.","dungeon_101007_3_7":"<color=#c05100>Elude</color>... How are you doing?","dungeon_101007_3_8":"Don't worry, I'm fine. These wounds are nothing.","dungeon_101007_3_9":"<color=#c05100>Eluller</color>, are you really a Valkyrie now? Have you really fought back the demons?","dungeon_101007_3_10":"Yes, Elude. I did it.","dungeon_101007_3_11":"<color=#c05100>Eluller</color>, you saved <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color> today. The Lytanis family is so proud of you.","dungeon_101007_3_12":"I'm... proud of you.","dungeon_101007_3_13":"<color=#c05100>Eluller</color>, you are now a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>. From now on, the responsibility of saving the world rests on your shoulders.","dungeon_101007_3_14":"We must head to <color=#c05100>Mirlond</color>, the sacred city of the Creator, first. The Valkyries will assemble there, as dictated by their pacts.","dungeon_101007_3_15":"Go, Eluller. Save the world and prove your worth to everyone.","dungeon_101007_3_16":"Understood, General. In the name of the <color=#c05100>Shield of Dawn</color>, I swear that I will not betray your expectations.","dungeon_101007_4_1":"This is the imperial city. A city built to worship the Valkyries. One may call it the <color=#ffa352>City of Valkyries</color>.","dungeon_101007_4_2":"Eluller was heavily injured in the battle. Let's take her to the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie Manor</color> to treat her wounds!","dungeon_101007_4_3":"Let's head over to the <color=#c05100>Hall of Heroes</color> first. There, we'll be able to recruit some strong allies.","dungeon_101007_5_1":"Let's head over to the <color=#ffa352>Hall of Heroes</color> first. There, we'll be able to recruit some strong allies.","dungeon_101007_5_2":"Jerald, I'm <color=#ffa352>Diana</color>, a ranger in charge of contacting Valkyries from everywhere.","dungeon_101007_5_3":"I'll go with you to the Starshard Valley to find the <color=#ffa352>Essence Elixir</color>","dungeon_101007_5_4":"It's an emergency. We'll set off right now!","dungeon_101007_5_5":"It possesses evil energy that opposes the Creator's light. It is definitely closely related to this doomsday catastrophe.","dungeon_101007_5_6":"I remember now! When I was still learning the ropes in the Woodland Temple, I once saw manuscripts about the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>.","dungeon_101007_5_7":"The Woodland Omniguardian would know something about this. We can pay a visit to <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color> and ask him about the pact.","dungeon_101007_5_8":"The <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color>... That's the Woodland to the north of the mainland. We have a long journey ahead of us.","dungeon_101007_5_9":"There's no time to waste. Let's head north now! The journey to save the world has only just begun...","dungeon_102001_1":"This is <color=#c05100>Starshard Valley</color>. It's a place that one has to pass through in order to reach <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color>.","dungeon_102001_2":"According to Empire scouts, members of the <color=#c05100>Eclipse</color> have been sighted in the valley recently. The Eclipse constantly opposed the Empire. There must be some sinister ploy behind this.","dungeon_102001_3":"The <color=#c05100>Eclipse</color>... When I was still a Woodland ranger, I fought this bunch of evil mutants frequently.","dungeon_102001_4":"If any Eclipse members dares to appear, I'll definitely shoot them to death with my arrows!","dungeon_102002_1_1":"Ah, be careful of those orange mushroom monsters! Those are <color=#c05100>Volcano Shrooms</color> created by the Eclipse!","dungeon_102002_1_2":"Don't be nervous! Killing these <color=#c05100>Volcano Shrooms</color> will trigger a self-destruction chain reaction that can help us quickly eliminate enemies!","guidance_102002_1":"The Empire's scouts have brought good news: the Queen is personally issuing a series of quests to encourage brave warriors in their fight against the evil.","guidance_102002_2":"We can earn splendid rewards by completing <color=#ffa352>Queen's Quests</color>.","dungeon_102003_1_1":"Look! The <color=#c05100>Heart of Madness</color> from the Eclipse! He was the one who converted the Woodland creatures with his potions.","dungeon_102003_1_2":"Someone's coming over so quickly? Why is the Empire and its lackeys always so persistent.","dungeon_102003_1_3":"My time is limited, so I'll let these cuties accompany you guys for the time being. Hahaha—","dungeon_102003_1":"The enemy is too strong!","dungeon_102003_2":"These guys sure are hardy. My sharpened blade can't pierce through their armor!","dungeon_102003_3":"I'm here to help! Leave these guys to me!","dungeon_102003_4":"What a brilliant move. Your swordsmanship is terrific!","dungeon_102003_5":"I'm <color=#ffa352>Themis</color>, the fastest swordfighter in the Empire!","dungeon_102003_6":"The enemies in this ruin are tough. Now that you've run into me, you're in luck. Let's go!","dungeon_102003_7":"The enemy's actions were too swift. By the time the soldiers saw the other party, they had already been struck down.","dungeon_102003_8":"According to them, enemies can manifest out of nowhere from shadows and merge with them.","dungeon_102003_9":"An assassin that can manipulate dark powers? Interesting...","dungeon_102003_10":"Whatever the case, I must recapture the <color=#c05100>Heart of Madness</color> and bring him to justice. I'll be acting alongside you guys during this period.","guidance_102004_1":"Come on, <color=#c05100>Felmyst</color>! Let's deal with these fiends together!","dungeon_102006_1_1":"The <color=#ffa352>Eclipsers</color> have been here. I have to leave immediately and report this to the Empire.","dungeon_102006_1_2":"Odysseus, it's been great fighting alongside you guys. I hope we get to do it again!","dungeon_102006_1_3":"Hold on. Can you gift me these corpses? I've been lacking experimental materials recently. Hahaha...","dungeon_102006_1_4":"Hm... Do as you wish, you alchemist freak.","dungeon_102006_1_5":"<color=#c05100>Felmyst</color>? Hahaha! We haven't met ever since you threw me into that dark and gloomy prison cell in the Empire ages ago.","dungeon_102006_1_6":"Who'd have thought the Imperial Inquisition would actually send their strongest enforcer after me?","dungeon_102006_1_7":"<color=#c05100>Percival</color>! Your atrocious crimes are unforgivable! I will bring you to justice today!","dungeon_102006_1_8":"Presumptuous fools! These alchemy potions will send you spiraling straight into madness amid your own maniacal laughter!","dungeon_102006_2_1":"The <color=#c05100>Heart of Madness</color> has already been caught. This time, I will send him to the darkest prison of the Empire.","dungeon_102006_2_2":"I hope to see you again, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian and Valkyrie</color>. Perhaps we will be joined against evil again someday soon.","dungeon_102006_2_3":"Yuna! My sister! How did this happen...","dungeon_102006_2_4":"There are many corpses of Woodland tribes left behind here... <color=#c05100>Gunnora</color>, do you know her?","dungeon_102006_2_5":"She's a <color=#c05100>Woodland ranger</color> just like me. We once fought to protect the Woodland together.","dungeon_102006_2_6":"These bastards actually killed her just like this and threw her by the road!","dungeon_102006_2_7":"Her wounds are awfully deep, and it seems there are even traces of residual dark powers inside.","dungeon_102006_2_8":"According to Felmyst, the <color=#c05100>Eclipse Assassin</color> that rescued the Heart of Madness can use dark power too. He may be the one behind this.","dungeon_102006_2_9":"An <color=#c05100>Eclipse Assassin</color>, huh... Well, he's my prey now. In my name as a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>, I swear I'll never let him off!","dungeon_102007_2":"Keep at it! I want this <color=#c05100>Mech Construct</color>!","dungeon_102007_3":"Look! That construct seems to be something from the valley ruins... The Eclipse is currently trying to control it!","dungeon_102007_4":"The strength of the <color=#c05100>Cyborg</color> is truly frightening. We have to stop these Eclipsers.","dungeon_102007_2_1":"Judging from its construction, the <color=#c05100>Cyborg</color> is a machine created to clean up enemies.","dungeon_102007_2_2":"The energy that it possesses is related to the ancient era. The ancient energy that the Oracle possess should be able to control it.","dungeon_102009_1_1":"<color=#c05100>Stannard</color>? ... How surprising. Why would the Dragon Mage who usually hides in the Woodland be here?","dungeon_102009_1_2":"I... The <color=#c05100>Last Dragonblood Stannard</color> will never bow down to evil! Haaa...!!!","dungeon_102009_1_3":"Damn! He's been controlled by evil magic and is attacking us!","dungeon_102009_2_1":"<color=#ffa352>Woodland Ranger Diana</color>, thanks for saving me. I'm very glad to see friends from the Woodland here.","dungeon_102009_2_2":"The <color=#ffa352>Lizard Mage Stannard</color> will join you in your search for the Valkyrie.","dungeon_102009_2_3":"Not long ago, I sensed a commotion in Starshard Valley and headed over to check on the situation. Unexpectedly, I was ambushed by an Eclipse Assassin.","dungeon_102009_2_4":"He called himself <color=#c05100>Evil Shadow Jack</color> and he used the powerful Pact of Darkness to devour me.","dungeon_102009_2_5":"<color=#c05100>Evil Shadow Jack</color>? I remember that name... He must be the one who killed the other Woodland rangers! Where is he right now?","dungeon_102009_2_6":"Follow me. Jack headed into the depths of Starshard Valley. He shouldn't have gone far yet.","dungeon_106001_1_1":"Dragon blood flows within my veins. Let me fight! The power of the dragons shall destroy our enemies!","dungeon_102012_1_1":"Phew, that was close to being turned into mud by the <color=#ffa352>Ruin Guardian</color>.","dungeon_102012_1_2":"This is the deepest part of the ruins, but no clues about the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color> have been found.","dungeon_102012_1_3":"Odysseus, look... behind the Relic Guardian's body, something is showing, it seems to be a road.","dungeon_102012_1_4":"In order to save the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color>, we can only continue to venture forward.","dungeon_102012_2_1":"You guys are too late. I have already obtained <color=#c05100>Percival's</color> alchemy manuscript.","dungeon_102012_2_2":"Soon, I'll be able to completely control the power of the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>, and all of you will be crushed into smithereens by the <color=#c05100>Ruin Guardian</color>.","dungeon_102012_2_3":"Unbelievable! He actually revived the <color=#c05100>Ruin Guardian</color> using the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>!","dungeon_102012_2_4":"Prepare for battle! Destroy that monstrosity! The Creator's grace stands with us!","dungeon_102012_3_1":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>... I never thought we'd ever encounter that evil power opposing the Creator again.","dungeon_102012_3_2":"It looks like we need to continue going after <color=#c05100>Jack</color>. We must stop him before he fully masters the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>.","dungeon_102012_3_3":"Yes, of course. I will definitely make <color=#c05100>Jack</color> pay in blood for what he's done!","dungeon_103001_1":"This dark cave is surprisingly something else, these evil gargoyle sculptures.... it should be the Eclipsers who are entrenched here.","dungeon_103001_2":"Let's turn this place upside down and make sure we find the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color>!","dungeon_103001_3":"<color=#c05100>Jack</color> is relying on the protection of the Eclipsers to buy himself time. We have to stop him from obtaining the power of the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>.","dungeon_103005_1":"<color=#c05100>Salazar</color>! The notorious Eclipse mutant. He's <color=#c05100>Jack</color>'s accomplice, isn't he?","dungeon_103005_2":"Right on the mark, <color=#c05100>Hare Ranger</color>. Still, it's too late. No one can stop the Eclipse's plans anymore.","dungeon_103005_3":"I shall lay all of you to rest in the shadows. You can continue your search for <color=#c05100>Jack</color> in eternal darkness!","dungeon_103005_4":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> strengthened the dark powers in his body. We have to go all out to defeat him!","dungeon_103005_1_1":"<color=#c05100>Salazar</color> has been devoured by the dark powers he uses. We've exterminated another formidable foe from the Eclipse!","dungeon_103005_1_2":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>' evil aura lingers here... We're getting closer and closer to <color=#c05100>Jack</color> now.","dungeon_103005_1_3":"Wonderful. This time, I will definitely corner <color=#c05100>Jack</color> in the cave and end him once and for all with my arrows.","dungeon_103010_1_1":"Jack! Hand over the Pact of Darkness! That power contradicts with the Creator and is not something that you can control!","dungeon_103010_1_2":"Oracle? Hahahaha, looks like you've completely figured out my plan.","dungeon_103010_1_3":"As long as I complete the ritual recorded in the alchemy manuscripts, I'll be able to completely control the Pact of Darkness and become the greatest servant of the darkness!","dungeon_103010_1_4":"Stop dreaming. With the Valkyrie and me here, your schemes and ambitions will never come to fruition.","dungeon_103010_2_5":"No! Just one last step... I cannot fall here!","dungeon_103010_2_6":"The enemy hides within the shadow once again and escapes...","dungeon_103010_2_7":"Hmph, don't worry. My arrows have wounded Jack in the battle just now.","dungeon_103010_2_8":"He can't go far. We'll be able to find him soon if we follow his tracks.","dungeon_103013_1_3":"Hi! <color=#c05100>Oracle</color>, it looks like you've also encountered some little skeletons.","dungeon_103013_1_4":"Come. Let us swiftly dispatch these ghastly things before they dirty my skirt.","dungeon_103013_1_5":"I can help! My magic will rip the enemy into shreds!","dungeon_103013_2_1":"<color=#c05100>Dorabella</color>? What is the Mage Council doing in a remote place like the Frostnight Cave?","dungeon_103013_2_2":"The Mage Council has unveiled the <color=#c05100>Arcanum Trials</color>, so I'm going around the continent to recruit warriors.","dungeon_103013_2_3":"<color=#c05100>Oracle</color>, you and your allies have already proven your worth to me. Maybe you guys are just who I'm looking for!","dungeon_103013_2_8":"I'm glad to see you. When the Demons invaded, the Mage Council suffered heavy losses.","dungeon_103013_2_9":"To motivate heroes in their fight against evil, the Mage Council has recently unveiled the <color=#c05100>Arcanum Trials</color> at my suggestion.","dungeon_103013_2_10":"The sooner you collect enough <color=#c05100>Trial Points</color>, the earlier I can join your team. You will also receive generous rewards from the Council.","dungeon_103015_1_1":"This is the mark of my people and it points towards the Foggy Jungle. This mark means... \"Danger\"!","dungeon_103015_1_2":"A clue left by the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color>, she must have gone in the direction of the Foggy Jungle.","dungeon_103015_1_3":"The <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie</color> is in danger, and we must hurry!","dungeon_103015_1_6":"Such glorious power! The festering flesh and pain are all gone. The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> is under my control now!","dungeon_103015_1_7":"Enough! I've had enough of your ravings, you lunatic from the Eclipse.","dungeon_103015_1_8":"<color=#c05100>Jack</color>! You will pay for your sins today!","dungeon_103015_2_1":"How can this be...? The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>... How could I have lost...?","dungeon_103015_2_2":"Face it, Jack. You're no match for the <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>'s holy powers. Now, blood will have blood!","dungeon_103015_2_4":"This shot is for the Woodland rangers you killed. May their souls rest in peace.","dungeon_103015_2_6":"What's going on?! Dark energy is overflowing from Jack! This doesn't look good...","dungeon_103015_2_7":"This is terrible! Although Jack is dead, the power of the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> in him is going berserk!","dungeon_103015_2_8":"We have to bring the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> under control as fast as we can! Or the entire cave is going to collapse from the impact!","dungeon_103015_2_9":"Leave it to me, Oracle. As a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>, I'm duty-bound to do this!","dungeon_104001_1_1":"This is the <color=#ffa352>Foggy Jungle</color>, where the mists are tainted with decay and the entire place is nothing but death…","dungeon_104001_1_2":"I have a bad feeling about this. Looks like we have to pick up the pace, the <color=#ffa352> Valkyrie</color> needs us!","dungeon_104001_1_3":"Now, the fog has been corrupted and the once-verdant woodland has turned gloomy and ominous. The <color=#c05100>Spirits of Nature</color> were also forced to vacate the Foggy Jungle and they made their way to the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color> in search of protection.","dungeon_104001_1_4":"The last time I passed by the area, the corruptive aura within the fog was not as thick as it is now.","dungeon_104001_1_5":"<color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>, I have a bad feeling about this. We better hurry up and leave the <color=#c05100>Foggy Jungle</color>.","dungeon_104001_1_6":"You're right, <color=#c05100>Gunnora</color>. We have to quickly find the exit. We'll be able to find out the truth behind the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> from the Oracle once we reach the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color>.","dungeon_104001_1_7":"The <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>?! How dare you show up before me?! I won't be deceived by the likes of you anymore... I will never let you off!","dungeon_104001_2_1":"This fog... The corruption has become even more severe. I feel like it's corrupting us right now...","dungeon_104001_2_2":"It seems like the corruptive aura has complete fused with the fog. It has become extremely dangerous.","dungeon_104001_2_3":"The corruptive aura is weakening both mine and <color=#c05100>Valkyrie's</color> holy power. We have to leave the <color=#c05100>Foggy Jungle</color> before we get infected.","dungeon_104001_2_4":"Can you tell me why you, a Twilight Guard, would be here? What is going on in the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color>?","dungeon_104001_2_5":"I'm not sure myself... The <color=#c05100>Woodland Oracle</color> had summoned me into the </color>Woodland Temple</color>, but when I was there, someone attacked me.","dungeon_104001_2_6":"I made a narrow escape, hobbling and staggering all the way into the <color=#c05100>Foggy Thicket</color>...","dungeon_104001_2_7":"The situation is bad. It seems like the dark power has crept its way into the <color=#c05101>Dreamwoods</color>.","dungeon_104001_2_8":"You are... the <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>? How is it that you're here?! This isn't possible...","dungeon_104001_2_9":"Calm down, <color=#c05100>Sylvan</color>. The Omniguardian has come to help us save the Woodland. He's an ally.","dungeon_104001_2_10":"I can't bring myself to trust him for now... Let's go, <color=#c05100>Merida</color>. We should keep our distance from these dubious bunch of people.","dungeon_104001_2_11":"There is trouble at the <color=#c05100>Woodland Temple</color>! We need to hurry over and help the Woodland tide over the crisis.","dungeon_104005_1_1":"Enemies have infiltrated the Woodland! Eliminate them and defend the Woodland!","dungeon_104005_2_1":"What a quick and effortless battle. You're as agile as ever, <color=#c05100>Gunnora</color>.","dungeon_104005_2_2":"You have no more ties with the Woodland. Tell me, why are you back here?","dungeon_104005_2_3":"I have signed a pact with the <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color> and am now a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>. Our current quest is to save the world.","dungeon_104005_2_4":"We need the <color=#c05100>Woodland Oracle</color>'s guidance to save the world. Of course, saving the world also includes resolving the forest's crisis.","dungeon_104005_2_5":"Perhaps you're really here to help save our Woodland, but I suggest you keep your guard up around that <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>.","dungeon_104005_2_6":"I am not sure why you bear such animosity toward me, but my actions will prove whose side I'm on.","dungeon_104005_2_7":"Hmph, I hope that's true, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>...","dungeon_104025_1_1":"Look! We've found it! The exit of the <color=#c05100>Foggy Jungle</color> is near that ray of light. The <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color> is just ahead!","dungeon_104025_1_2":"Hold on! My ranger instincts tell me that something's not right...","dungeon_104025_1_3":"The <color=#c05100>Woodland Oracle</color> has revealed your misdeeds to the <color=#c05100>Twilight Guards</color>. You're now an enemy of the woodland!","dungeon_104025_1_4":"Your scheme to destroy the Woodland ends here, <color=#c05100>Sylvan</color>! The <color=#c05100>World Guardian</color> will stop you!","dungeon_104025_2_1":"All of you are not allowed into the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color>... Invaders, remain lost in the fog and be consumed by the corruptive aura...","dungeon_104025_2_2":"The <color=#c05100>Spirits of Nature</color>?! I didn't expect that they too would succumb to the corruptive aura.","dungeon_104025_2_3":"Woodland Oracle? The Spirits of Nature told me that the <color=#c05100>Woodland Oracle</color> is currently speaking with the <color=#c05100>Tree of Life</color> in his dreams.","dungeon_104025_2_4":"But... I saw him in the temple. He gave me the order himself.","dungeon_104025_2_5":"Believe me, I am the Woodland Oracle's disciple. My words are never wrong.","dungeon_104025_2_6":"This is really puzzling... But I believe you.","dungeon_104025_2_7":"I knew that <color=#c05100>Sylvan</color> would never betray the <color=#c05100>Woodland Temple</color> for no reason. I was too focused on carrying out the order.","dungeon_104025_2_8":"Thank you for believing me, <color=#c05100>Haine</color>. Woodland Oracle and the Omniguardian... Things are getting stranger by the minute.","dungeon_104025_2_9":"Let's start making our way to the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color>. I'll tell all of you about my encounter when we get there.","dungeon_105001_1_1":"We're here. The <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color> is the home of many Woodland tribes. The heart of the Woodland, <color=#c05100>Nolutral the Tree of Life</color>, has offered us peace and protection for thousands of years.","dungeon_105001_1_2":"The <color=#c05100>Oracle</color> is at the <color=#c05100>Woodland Temple</color> at the foot of the Tree of Life. He'll definitely be able to help us resist the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> and uncover the truth regarding the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>!","dungeon_105001_1_3":"What a disaster. Judging from the unstable flow of magic nearby, it seems like even the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color> has been affected by the corruptive aura.","dungeon_105001_1_4":"In that case, perhaps the entire Woodland will think of us as their enemies. We should proceed with caution.","dungeon_105001_2_1":"As I expected, the Woodland Defenders have been corrupted and are now enemies.","dungeon_105001_2_2":"The corruptive aura here is a little strange. It does not seem to come from the <color=#c05100>Foggy Jungle</color>. Instead, it seems like it originates from the core of the Woodland.","dungeon_105001_2_3":"The living creatures of the <color=#c05100>Dreamwoods</color> are currently suffering. Their cries reverberate throughout the Woodland... It comes from <color=#c05100>Nolutral the Tree of Life</color>...","dungeon_105001_2_4":"The woodland told us that the <color=#c05100>Oracle</color> is currently speaking with the Tree of Life in his dreams. The enemy must have made use of this opportunity to take over the <color=#c05100>Woodland Temple</color>.","dungeon_105001_2_5":"The enemy is trying to use the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> to infect the <color=#c05100>Tree of Life</color>... We must prevent the disaster from happening...","dungeon_105001_2_6":"Hmm... I think that the <color=#c05100>Oracle</color> the <color=#c05100>Spirits of Nature</color> met is likely an imposter sent by the enemy. It's probably also the <color=#c05100>Oracle imposter</color> who used the corruptive aura to taint the Woodland and control the Woodland Defenders.","dungeon_105001_2_7":"<color=#c05100>Impersonating the Woodland Oracle</color> and controlling the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color>... The evil power that the enemy wields is exceptionally strong.","dungeon_105001_2_8":"<color=#c05100>Dorabella</color>, you possess the qualifications to become a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>. When the time is right, I hope that you can sign a pact with me and eliminate the enemy.","dungeon_105005_2_1":"I can feel the dark power that opposes the Creator's light. These enemies of the Woodland... They've been corrupted by the evil aura of the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>!","dungeon_105005_2_2":"Hmm, thinking back to what <color=#c05100>Sylvan</color> experienced... Perhaps someone used the Pact of Darkness to impersonate the <color=#c05100>Oracle</color> and took advantage of the situation at the <color=#c05100>Woodland Temple</color>...","dungeon_105005_2_3":"That's not all. They also wanted <color=#c05100>Sylvan</color> dead, to prevent her from becoming a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>.","dungeon_105005_2_4":"These actions go against the will of the Creator! The enemy is more frightening than expected... <color=#c05100>Sylvan</color>! Only with your <color=#c05100>Valkyric Power</color> can we save the Woodland!","dungeon_105005_2_5":"Don't worry, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>. If I truly have what it takes to become a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color> and when the time is right, I will use that power to defeat anyone who attempts to create havoc in the Woodland!","dungeon_105035_1_1":"Welcome back, <color=#c05100>Spirits of Nature</color>. The instigator behind the corruptive aura has been eliminated. The Woodland Temple is safe once again.","dungeon_105035_1_2":"An <color=#c05100>imposter</color> disguised by the dark forces... We'll no longer fall for your tricks...","dungeon_105035_1_3":"You're not the <color=#c05100> Oracle</color>. Who are you?","dungeon_105035_1_4":"What are you saying, <color=#c05100>Merida</color>, my beloved disciple? Do you not recognize your master?","dungeon_105035_1_5":"Alright, you <color=#c05100>imposter</color>. Your silly tricks will no longer work. It's time you show your true identity!","dungeon_105035_1_6":"Hahahaha! I'm impressed, you're a little smarter than I expected.","dungeon_105035_1_7":"That <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>... An evil force capable of opposing the Creator. Where did it come from?","dungeon_105035_1_8":"There's no need to ask so much about it, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>. All of you will meet your doom today.","dungeon_105035_1_9":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>... It's emitting an unprecedented evil power... This power is exactly the same as that at the source of the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> in the Woodland...","dungeon_105035_1_10":"Yes... He may just be an imposter of the Woodland Oracle, but we still shouldn't underestimate our enemy.","dungeon_105035_1_11":"Sign a pact with me now, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>! I want to become a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>! No matter what, I have to teach this imposter a lesson!","dungeon_105035_2_1":"We did it! The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>' clone disappeared!","dungeon_105035_2_2":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> has been shattered... The <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> in the Woodland will also be purified by the <color=#c05100>Tree of Life</color>... The Woodland is now saved...","dungeon_105035_2_3":"Don't forget that this is all thanks to the pact between the <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color> and I that allowed me to become a <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color>.","dungeon_105035_2_4":"Well done, heroes. All of you saved the Woodland from the dark forces.","dungeon_105035_2_5":"<color=#c05100>Woodland Oracle Paragon</color>! You're back from your dreams!","dungeon_105035_2_6":"That's right, <color=#c05100>Merida</color> my student. I was receiving guidance from the Tree of Life in my dreams when the nightmare created by the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> engulfed me.","dungeon_105035_2_7":"When the <color=#c05100>Valkyrie</color> defeated the imposter created by the Pact of Darkness, I was freed from the nightmare as well.","dungeon_105035_2_8":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color>... It's been a constant thorn in our sides impeding our progress throughout our quest to save the world.","dungeon_105035_2_9":"The <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> belongs to <color=#c05100>Cardios the Ruler</color>, who is also the instigator of the doomsday catastrophe.","dungeon_105035_2_10":"You'll have to seek help from the Divines to learn the full truth behind the <color=#c05100>Pact of Darkness</color> and <color=#c05100>Cardios the Ruler</color>.","dungeon_105035_2_11":"The Divines live in the <color=#c05100>Seraphic Court</color> above the <color=#c05100>Arctic Plateau</color> in the north. You will have to travel north and traverse the Arctic Plateau.","dungeon_105035_2_12":"Thank you for your guidance, Woodland Oracle.","dungeon_105035_2_13":"Let's go, we should now set off for our next destination—<color=#c05100>Seraphic Court</color>, the homeland of the Divines!","guidance_101000_1_1":"The Demonic Dragon has appeared and is rampaging all around the capital.","guidance_101000_1_2":"Time is running out! We have to find the <color=#c05100>Valkyries</color> before it completely destroys this place!","guidance_101002_1_1":"Thank you, warrior. You helped me stop these Demons' despicable attack.","guidance_101002_1_2":"No need to thank me for doing my job, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>. I'm Eluller, the Shield of Dawn.","guidance_101002_1_3":"Time is running out! The <color=#c05100>Empire Sanctuary</color> is just ahead! I will fight alongside you to stop the Demons from tarnishing the <color=#c05100>Omniseal Shard</color>!","guidance_20701_1":"Wow! That was one dangerous battle just now! We almost didn't make it out alive!","guidance_20701_2":"The enemies here have grown significantly stronger. We must be extra careful.","guidance_20701_3":"We bagged a lot of <color=#ffa352>loot</color> in the last battle. There should be something useful among the spoils.","guidance_20701_4":"Open the chest and take a look.","guidance_21301_1":"<color=#ffa352>Jerald</color>, don't you think that a team charged with a mission as important as ours should have a name?","guidance_21301_2":"Yes, let's give our team a name people will remember!","guidance_21302_1":"{0}? Heh, I like it.","guidance_21302_2":"The name of team {0} will echo down the annals of history through their legendary deeds.","guidance_21701_1":"Wow! There really are a lot of people here!","guidance_21701_2":"The Arena is the most popular place in the Empire.","guidance_21701_3":"Warriors gather here from all over the world. If you defeat them, you'll win a reward from the Queen.","guidance_21701_4":"What an interesting place. We should be able to find some decent competition here.","guidance_21701_5":"Then hurry up and sign yourself up. Let's see who's really the strongest here!","guidance_22401_1":"Incredible! The space inside is larger than it appears from the outside!","guidance_22401_2":"This place wasn't here when the Empire occupied this area. It seems that the <color=#ffa352>Eclipse</color> really uncovered something incredible here...","guidance_22401_3":"Look, the Woodland Twins have helped me to interpret the message left behind on this rune. This place is called the Palace of Penrose... It's some kind of otherworldly realm connected to the Abyss.","guidance_22401_4":"A large number of Demons have made this place their home, and countless treasures lie within it!","guidance_22401_5":"Indeed. I can sense the enemy's evil presence from the depths of the palace. It's time we started exploring.","guidance_22401_6":"Keep your guard and be ready for a fight!","guidance_23101_1":"This used to be the temple of Surtr—the  God of Fire. Rumor has it that there are countless Relics left hidden about here.","guidance_23101_2":"Although they probably won't be easy to obtain.","guidance_23101_3":"Let's look around here. Maybe we can find something.","guidance_23401_1":"Whoa! Look! Those shelves have so many sealed books.","guidance_23401_2":"This archive was once used by the gods. These books chronicle the life and deeds of past heroes.","guidance_23401_3":"I can break the magical seals on these books, allowing us to relive the experiences of these heroes.","guidance_23401_4":"Great! Let's get started! I love reading!","guidance_23601_1":"The enemies are hiding within the Celestial Realm. I can taste the stench of their evil on the air.","guidance_23601_2":"Hmph. Nothing to fear. They're little more than phantoms after all.","guidance_23601_3":"Let's not get cocky here. Stick to your formations. Let's break through their lines.","guidance_23801_1":"As the <color=#ffa352>Tree of Life</color> was corrupted, the flowers in the Gloomwoods turned into the Vileflowers...","guidance_23801_2":"These Vileflowers look extremely hostile.","guidance_23801_3":"According to ancient records, if the flowers are fed fresh monster blood, they can draw magic from it and create <color=#ffa352>Terra Crystals</color>.","guidance_23801_4":"These magical <color=#ffa352>Terra Crystals</color> can provide heroes with more power.","guidance_23801_5":"If doing this will give us an edge in battle, we should boldly take the challenge! Hurry, catch some monsters and feed them to these flowers!","guidance_21611_1":"Deploy me! I will slay the enemy with my blade!","guidance_23102_1":"Look. That podium seems a little different from its surroundings.","guidance_23102_2":"My instincts tell me there's something there.","guidance_23102_3":"Be careful, a powerful monster seems to be sealed there. Approaching it would be difficult.","guidance_23102_4":"Let's examine our surroundings and look around for some clues.","guidance_23121_1":"Whoa! These guys are powerful!","guidance_23121_2":"Looks like we've taken a few scrapes. It's not wise to keep pushing ahead recklessly.","guidance_23121_3":"Let's patch ourselves out first before continuing.","guidance_22201_1":"<color=#ffa352>Omniguardians</color> complete quests to get <color=#ffa352>healing items</color>, the Valkyrie's safety is in your hands!","guidance_23511_1":"This place used to symbolize the peace among the Empire, Woodland, and Eclipse peoples. It's turned into this living hell now...","guidance_23511_2":"Once we defeat the demons occupying this space, things will get better. Come with me, <color=#ffa352>Merida</color>.","guidance_24201_1":"We've finally rid the area of devils. Look over there, <color=#ffa352>Jerald</color>! A portal has appeared.","guidance_24201_2":"Legend has it that this city's districts are connected by magic. We should be able to use the portal to go deeper.","guidance_24201_3":"I suppose it can't be that easy to resolve. We have no choice but to keep going.","dungeon_103015_3_1":"Collect enough Pact Shards and proceed to the <color=#ffa352>Valkyrie Manor</color> to learn more about the Valkyries and gain their blessings.","dungeon_103015_3_2":"The legend of the Valkyrie is recorded in the Valkyrie Homestead, and the power blessing of the Valkyries can be activated by offering the fragments of the contract. Learn about the Valkyries' past and get extra rewards.","dungeon_103010_2_3":"It bears a close resemblance to the energy emitted by an <color=#c05100>Omniseal Shard</color>—which is what I'm here to retrieve.","dungeon_103015_2_5":"If you're interested, find me in <color=#c05100>Dawn City</color>.","dungeon_100000_1_7":"Like it was made of glass! The <color=#c05100>Omniseal</color> has shattered, and it looks like the powerless <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color> is equally worthless now.","dungeon_101007_2_5":"I am Hallios, the <color=#c05100>Omniseal</color>'s chosen <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>.","dungeon_101006_3_9":"I will destroy all your hopes and end the human empire!","dungeon_104002_1_1":"These monsters... They used to be Woodland Defenders. But the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> has robbed them of their sanity and turned them into our enemies...","dungeon_104002_1_2":"We will find a way to purify the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> and save the jungle one day. For now, I hope the holy power will help them find peace.","dungeon_104002_2_1":"Urgh! The impact of the <color=#c05100>corruptive aura</color> is intensifying... It's weakening my holy power severely!","dungeon_104002_2_2":"Brace yourselves! This will be a fierce battle!","dungeon_104002_3_1":"Hi, <color=#c05100>Omniguardian</color>! What a coincidence. I didn't think we'd be meeting in <color=#c05100>Foggy Jungle</color>.","dungeon_104002_3_2":"The arcanum magic has already purified the <color=#c05100>corrupting aura</color> in this area, which allows us to make short work of these guys now!","dungeon_104002_4_1":"I'm much obliged for your help, <color=#c05100>Arcane Mage Dorabella</color>. Why are you here in the <color=#c05100>Foggy Jungle</color>, though?","dungeon_104002_4_2":"The <color=#c05100>Spirits of Nature</color> sisters have commissioned me to concoct a <color=#c05100>potion</color> to suppress the corruptive aura. I came here to verify the efficacy of the potion.","dungeon_104002_4_3":"Concocting this thing took some doing, I must say. Still, it appears to have produced rather limited results.

Who do you think you are?","dialogue_main_10212_1_6":"That's enough, Franz! You're going too far.","dialogue_main_10212_1_7":"Heh.

Follow me!","dialogue_main_10315_1_1":"Within the colossal iron cage, a slender figure is ensnared by iron chains.","dialogue_main_10315_1_2":"She bows her head, eyes closed, and her wings tremble uncontrollably, as if all color has faded away.","dialogue_main_10315_1_3":"I confirm, this is indeed the aura of Elune.","dialogue_main_10315_1_4":"Let's charge in, but the cage seems flawless.

I saw her on the way.","dialogue_main_10425_2_9":"She was heading toward the <color=#ffa352>Northern Plateau</color>, I think the <color=#ffa352>Queen Athena was with her</color>.","dialogue_main_10425_2_10":"As the <color=#ffa352>Empire queen</color> is involved..., <color=#ffa352>the situation must be dire!</color>","dialogue_main_10425_2_11":"What are we waiting for? Let's move out!","dialogue_main_10501_1_1":"The presence of the Abyss is strong...","dialogue_main_10501_1_2":"There's no shortage of monsters here.","dialogue_main_10501_1_3":"The air over the plateau... (coughing) This place is so unforgiving!","dialogue_main_10501_1_4":"Merida, come to me.","dialogue_main_10501_1_5":"It's alri...","dialogue_main_10501_1_6":"Rawwwrrrr!","dialogue_main_10501_1_7":"Everyone, watch out!","dialogue_main_10501_2_1":"This is a dreadful place...","dialogue_main_10501_2_2":"Are you okay, Eluller?","dialogue_main_10501_2_3":"<color=#ffa352>Salleine</color>, it's been a while. I should have seen this coming since <color=#ffa352>this is your territory</color>.","dialogue_main_10501_2_4":"Have you seen Dorabella?","dialogue_main_10501_2_5":"No, but I did see Her Majesty.","dialogue_main_10501_2_6":"Her Majesty was heading toward the <color=#ffa352>northern border of the plateau</color>. It's said <color=#ffa352>a large group of Abyss Magimons</color> has amassed there.","dialogue_main_10501_2_7":"You have our thanks.","dialogue_main_10501_2_8":"My pleasure. Unfortunately, I cannot go with you.","dialogue_main_10501_2_9":"I must protect the Empire's people. That is also Her Majesty's order.","dialogue_main_10501_2_10":"It'll be a walk in the park. We've got this!","dialogue_main_10535_1_1":"(Huffing)... The air is getting... even thinner...","dialogue_main_10535_1_2":"Keep going! Almost there!","dialogue_main_10535_1_3":"I think I can see Athena.","dialogue_main_10535_1_4":"Me too... Wow, she's still such a fearless fighter!","dialogue_main_10535_1_5":"But how is she surrounded by even more monsters than before?","dialogue_main_10535_1_6":"—Get ready. We must join the battle!","dialogue_main_10535_2_1":"The Omniguardian of the Covenant Temple is powerful indeed.","dialogue_main_10535_2_2":"Are you okay?","dialogue_main_10535_2_3":"I am a fighter and a conqueror, not a timid palace dweller.","dialogue_main_10535_2_4":"<color=#ffa352>Several rifts have appeared on the Mainland</color>. What we have encountered is nothing but <color=#ffa352>retaliation and infiltration of the Abyss</color>.","dialogue_main_10535_2_5":"The force that created these rifts is very unusual. <color=#ffa352>Dorabella has been tracing the source of it</color>.","dialogue_main_10535_2_6":"That's why she isn't here. She's searching for the unknown force.","dialogue_main_10535_2_7":"Do you recall which direction Dorabella was heading?","dialogue_main_10535_2_8":"The Abyss force was heading toward the <color=#ffa352>Frozen Peaks</color>, I think. She must be fighting her way up the snowy mountains.","dialogue_main_10535_2_9":"Is Dorabella fighting all by herself?... Omniguardian, I'm worried about her.","dialogue_main_10535_2_10":"Yes. Let's head out now.","dialogue_main_10601_1_1":"It sure is freezing up here!","dialogue_main_10601_1_2":"Waah... I can't stop shivering! Snow and I just don't get along!","dialogue_main_10601_1_3":"Keep going, Merida... Mmm...","dialogue_main_10601_1_4":"You look quite pale, too.","dialogue_main_10601_1_5":"Are you all right?","dialogue_main_10601_1_6":"My wound stings a little, but it's nothing to worry about.","dialogue_main_10601_1_7":"We've come this far. <color=#ffa352>Let's keep pushing</color>!","dialogue_main_10601_2_1":"Who's back there?!","dialogue_main_10601_2_2":"Huh...? <color=#ffa352>Lord Albert</color>?","dialogue_main_10601_2_3":"You're as sharp as ever, my child.","dialogue_main_10601_2_4":"Lord Albert, you <color=#ffa352>command the Tower of Knowledge</color>. You ought to be able to sense her presence, right?","dialogue_main_10601_2_5":"Indeed. The Ethereal power has never been skilled at masking itself, and even less so when it concerns Dorabella.","dialogue_main_10601_2_6":"Go and check the <color=#ffa352>highest peak</color>. <color=#ffa352>Traces of her Ethereal power</color> should still be there.","dialogue_main_10601_2_7":"Won't you join us? Things will go much more smoothly with your help.","dialogue_main_10601_2_8":"This tower in front of you holds the knowledge that we accumulated over the past several thousand years.","dialogue_main_10601_2_9":"I devoted my whole life to the Tower of Knowledge, so I must remain here to guard it.","dialogue_main_10601_2_10":"Besides, the Omniguardian of the Covenant Temple won't disappoint us. Am I right?","dialogue_main_10601_2_11":"I won't disappoint anyone.","dialogue_main_10601_2_12":"Hehehehe... Very good, Omniguardian. You should be on your way.","dialogue_main_10601_2_13":"Omniguardian, let's go!","dialogue_main_10640_1_1":"<color=#ffa352>Dorabella's aura is very faint</color>...","dialogue_main_10640_1_2":"Most of it is obscured by the presence of the Abyss. It's very difficult to stay on the track.","dialogue_main_10640_1_3":"The abyssal force is approaching.","dialogue_main_10640_1_4":"Her situation looks dire.","dialogue_main_10640_1_5":"Those look like <color=#ffa352>footprints</color>...","dialogue_main_10640_1_6":"Don't hesitate. Follow the footprints!","dialogue_main_10640_2_1":"Watch out. Someone's hiding there!","dialogue_main_10640_2_2":"...I... see... you!","dialogue_main_10640_2_3":"It's you, the <color=#ffa352>Sinister Assassin Brutus</color>! What are you talking about?","dialogue_main_10640_2_4":"Ha! ...Protect... Elu...","dialogue_main_10640_2_5":"Valkyrie... Kill!","dialogue_main_10640_2_6":"The presence of the Abyss is strong, his body is covered in black spots, and his speech is incoherent—all these signs indicate that...","dialogue_main_10640_2_7":"He's been corrupted.","dialogue_main_10640_2_8":"<color=#ffa352>Corrupted by the power of the Abyss</color>?... Then we can't talk to him properly.","dialogue_main_10640_2_9":"...Dorabella... El... Kill!","dialogue_main_10640_2_10":"Dorabella—— Brutus, what happened to Dorabella?!","dialogue_main_10640_2_11":"...Uh... Fol...low...!","dialogue_main_10640_2_12":"——Follow... Follow him?","dialogue_main_10640_2_13":"The <color=#ffa352>Flamerock Wastes</color> are in that direction, but we can't fully trust Brutus...","dialogue_main_10640_2_14":"This is our only lead.","dialogue_main_10640_2_15":"We should catch up with him first.","dialogue_main_10640_2_16":"Okay, Dorabella, Brutus... What is going on?","dialogue_main_10701_1_1":"Even the wind and the dust smell like the Abyss... Omniguardian, I sense a <color=#ffa352>lot of conflicts here</color>.","dialogue_main_10701_1_2":"I feel the same way.","dialogue_main_10701_1_3":"Take caution, everyone.","dialogue_main_10701_1_4":"...Something is moving up ahead behind that rock. Stay alert!","dialogue_main_10701_1_5":"Hmm... It feels just like the <color=#ffa352>Abyssal Power</color> that has possessed Brutus!","dialogue_main_10701_1_6":"Watch out——","dialogue_main_10701_1_7":"It's the Abyss Magimons! Brace yourselves for combat!","dialogue_main_10701_2_1":"Urgh... These monsters are quite tough, and more are coming!","dialogue_main_10701_2_2":"This place looks and smells like a trap. Did Brutus lure us here to die?","dialogue_main_10701_2_3":"That's possible. It's <color=#ffa352>extremely difficult to remain sane</color> after being corrupted. He'll most likely follow the will of the Abyss.","dialogue_main_10701_2_4":"But we would've run into these monsters sooner or later... Who's there?","dialogue_main_10701_2_5":"It's been a long time, my friends.","dialogue_main_10701_2_6":"<color=#ffa352>Minotaur</color>! Why are you here?","dialogue_main_10701_2_7":"I followed the monsters here and was ambushed.","dialogue_main_10701_2_8":"So I had to blend into the earth to avoid the Magimons that surrounded me. I'm so glad to see you here.","dialogue_main_10701_2_9":"Looks like you don't know much about this place either... Have you seen Brutus?","dialogue_main_10701_2_10":"Brutus? The Eclipse assassin? I don't think so.","dialogue_main_10701_2_11":"All right. We've been following his trail. He was corrupted by the Abyss and lost his mind.","dialogue_main_10701_2_12":"Allowing him to wander freely may cause a lot of harm. Besides, he has <color=#ffa352>clues about Dorabella's</color> location.","dialogue_main_10701_2_13":"Is Dorabella missing?","dialogue_main_10701_2_14":"Yes, and that's why we must find Brutus.","dialogue_main_10701_2_15":"Then let me lend you a hand.","dialogue_main_10701_2_16":"Our team is growing! Eluller will be relieved to have your help.","dialogue_main_10701_2_17":"Hahahaha! The honor is mine.","dialogue_main_10740_1_1":"Ssss... Ssss... Kill!","dialogue_main_10740_1_2":"Brutus is over there! Goodness, the <color=#ffa352>Abyssal Power is going to swallow him</color>!","dialogue_main_10740_1_3":"If the Abyss overtakes him, we'll <color=#ffa352>never find out what happened to Dorabella</color>!","dialogue_main_10740_1_4":"We must try to stop the corruption!","dialogue_main_10740_1_5":"He spotted us. We have to subdue him first!","dialogue_main_10740_1_6":"Okay!","dialogue_main_10740_2_1":"Ugh... ugh... kill... uh...!","dialogue_main_10740_2_2":"Got him... What should we do now?","dialogue_main_10740_2_3":"Let me give it a try.","dialogue_main_10740_2_4":"Mmm... Ahh...!","dialogue_main_10740_2_5":"That was amazing, Omniguardian! The Abyss force in his body has been sealed, and he's getting better by the minute!","dialogue_main_10740_2_6":"...Uh... You... Guardian Valkyrie?","dialogue_main_10740_2_7":"Looks like you've regained your senses. Tell us everything you know!","dialogue_main_10740_2_8":"Uh... The Abyss Magimons attacked and broke through our defense...","dialogue_main_10740_2_9":"And then... I blacked out...","dialogue_main_10740_2_10":"What about Dorabella? You mentioned her name when you were delirious!","dialogue_main_10740_2_11":"Ethereal... She's... at... Frostnight... ugh...","dialogue_main_10740_2_12":"His strength is drained. He just passed out.","dialogue_main_10740_2_13":"Frostnight... You mean the <color=#ffa352>Frostnight Cave</color>?","dialogue_main_10740_2_14":"There's no time to lose.","dialogue_main_10740_2_15":"Move out!","dialogue_main_10740_2_16":"What about him?","dialogue_main_10740_2_17":"I'll keep him safe. Go find Dorabella.","dialogue_main_10801_1_1":"Some of these fissures all the way extend downward while others stay near the surface... Dorabella must have faced a fierce battle here.","dialogue_main_10801_1_2":"The entrance to the cave is nowhere to be found. What should we do?","dialogue_main_10801_1_3":"Dorabella had told me an <color=#ffa352>entrance to the Abyss was sealed</color> underground here at Frostnight.","dialogue_main_10801_1_4":"To locate the cave, we must activate all <color=#ffa352>four sealstones</color> located in four directions around Frostnight.","dialogue_main_10801_1_5":"Activating the stone may reveal the cave entrance.","dialogue_main_10801_1_6":"Then let's get started.","dialogue_main_10801_2_1":"Here's a seal stone! I'll go for it!","dialogue_main_10801_2_2":"Voooom——","dialogue_main_10801_2_3":"...Hmm, I can sense the cave's rough location. This is working!","dialogue_main_10801_2_4":"Then, what are we waiting for? Let's look for the other three!","dialogue_main_10840_1_1":"So this is the depths of the Frostnight Cave? It's so dark...","dialogue_main_10840_1_2":"Look! Inside that ice... it's Lady Dorabella!","dialogue_main_10840_1_3":"Wait, don't rush over.","dialogue_main_10840_1_4":"Before we rescue her, let's clear out the monsters lurking in the shadows!","dialogue_main_10840_1_5":"Omniguardian! You're awake! Wait——","dialogue_main_10840_1_6":"Omniguardian...","dialogue_main_10840_1_7":"Are you okay?","dialogue_main_10840_1_8":"I used a little too much magic...","dialogue_main_10840_1_9":"Dorabella, have you discovered the source of these rifts?","dialogue_main_10840_1_10":"...I see. You must have heard a lot from Athena.","dialogue_main_10840_1_11":"Well, the force is quite cunning. It vanished after corrupting Brutus.","dialogue_main_10840_1_12":"You know, it's really dark down here... Shall we have this talk elsewhere?","dialogue_main_10840_1_13":"——Wait, what's that giant shadow back there?!","dialogue_main_10840_1_14":"Hmm... That's the thing that drained my magic. It looks like an <color=#ffa352>Abyss Magimon broke through the seal</color>.","dialogue_main_10840_1_15":"What?!","dialogue_main_10840_1_16":"We must get rid of it before we leave.","dialogue_main_10840_1_17":"Weapons at the ready!","dialogue_main_10840_2_1":"Omniguardian...","dialogue_main_10840_2_2":"Lady Dorabella, your face looks so pale.","dialogue_main_10840_2_3":"I'm fine. It's just that the ice has frozen my magic power...","dialogue_main_10840_2_4":"Aiushtha has gone to the <color=#ffa352>volcano</color>, where the corruption is worst. We need to get there quickly.","dialogue_main_10840_2_5":"Don't push yourself. We can head back to the city and prepare before taking action.","dialogue_main_10840_2_6":"Time to head back","dialogue_main_10840_2_7":"Let's return to Mirlond first","dialogue_main_10840_2_8":"...","dialogue_main_10840_2_9":"Argh!","dialogue_main_10840_2_10":"Lady Dorabella, are you all right? You seem paler than before...","dialogue_main_10840_2_11":"My magic has been depleted. But a little rest is all I need.","dialogue_main_10840_2_12":"I'll take you back to Mirlond.","dialogue_main_10840_2_13":"Okay... I've been away for a while. It's time to go back for a visit.","dialogue_main_10101_3_4":"I'm not sure. What happened here?","dialogue_main_10101_6_15":"I'm {0}.","dialogue_main_10101_6_16":"Omnideus...? Omniguardian... What is that?","dialogue_main_10102_3_10":"You don't look well. Stay here and rest!","dialogue_main_10106_1_10":"For thousands of years? I have no relevant memories.","dialogue_main_10106_2_4":"Power crystal? Go retrieve it to heal Eluller!","dialogue_main_10102_3_11":"Leave it to me! I'll find Arkdina!","dialogue_main_10204_1_1":"Where do all these footprints come from?","dialogue_main_10204_1_2":"Proceed with caution. This can be a trap.","dialogue_main_10204_1_3":"(Rustling noises...)","dialogue_main_10204_1_4":"Tsk. It seems Sacred Galo lies somewhere deeper in this valley...","dialogue_main_10204_1_5":"It's the <color=#ffa352>The Eclipsers</color>!","dialogue_main_10204_1_6":"Oh? It's the Woodland Deer.","dialogue_main_10204_1_7":"I knew it. They are looking for herbs as well. <color=#ffa352>We must not let him get to it first</color>.","dialogue_main_10204_1_8":"Ha. That's not up to you to decide!","dialogue_main_10204_2_1":"That one went over there!","dialogue_main_10204_2_2":"Let's move.","dialogue_main_10204_2_3":"We should go check it out as well.","dialogue_main_10206_1_1":"Lady Themis, thank you for helping!","dialogue_main_10206_1_2":"I have a task at hand. I just happened to pass through here.","dialogue_main_10206_1_3":"Besides... I would never stand by and watch Franz do bad things!","dialogue_main_10206_1_4":"But time is running out on me, and I must tend to my own matter now.","dialogue_main_10206_1_5":"Don't worry. I won't let him get away with this, either. You can count on me.","dialogue_main_10206_1_6":"I'll leave this to you, then.","dialogue_main_10206_1_7":"If you are ever in need, feel free to come find me.","dialogue_main_10209_1_1":"Only the roots are left... It seems Franz has taken the Sacred Galo!","dialogue_main_10209_1_2":"We are too late.","dialogue_main_10209_1_3":"If we <color=#ffa352>find Franz</color> quickly, there might still be a chance.","dialogue_main_10209_1_4":"--Watch out. This is Franz's trap!","dialogue_main_10209_1_5":"Then we'll take them out!","dialogue_main_10209_2_1":"...Sss...","dialogue_main_10209_2_2":"Lady Eluller, are you okay?","dialogue_main_10209_2_3":"You need to rest.","dialogue_main_10209_2_4":"It's okay. I can still fight, but we must find Franz now!","dialogue_main_10209_2_5":"It's okay. I can still fight, but we must find Franz now!","dialogue_main_10212_2_17":"Let's grant you the power to banish the Abyss first.","dialogue_main_10212_2_18":"I... Understood, Omniguardian.","dialogue_summer_10001_0_1":"(…Melody plays…)","dialogue_summer_10001_0_2":"No... Don't...","dialogue_summer_10001_0_3":"Please don't...","dialogue_summer_10001_0_4":"No...","dialogue_summer_10001_1_1":"What was that just now... a dream? Why am I feeling so anxious?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_2":"This signal... it seems to be a message from my people. Has something happened in the ocean?!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_3":"Marina, are you okay?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_4":"What brings you guys here?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_5":"You don't look so well.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_6":"You seem troubled.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_7":"Just now, I sensed a weird magical flux coming from your room. What happened?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_8":"A magical flux...? Might have something to do with the weird dream I just had.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_9":"(Marina shares her dream)","dialogue_summer_10001_1_10":"So, you're saying your people sent you a message from miles away across the ocean?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_11":"I can't be sure.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_12":"But I've been away from home for so long, something must've happened in the ocean that I don't know about.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_13":"No big deal, we'll go back with you to check it out.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_14":"Really?!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_15":"Absolutely!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_16":"Hey, don't decide for everyone!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_17":"Awesome! Let's get going!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_18":"Don't we need to prepare?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_19":"I'm not ready yet.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_20":"Wow, way to kill the vibe...","dialogue_summer_10001_1_21":"No prep is needed. You're visiting my homeland, I'll take care of you!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_22":"So, I heard you're going on a vacation to the island?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_23":"You're quick with news. Yes, we're visiting Marina's homeland, the Merfolk kingdom.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_24":"Normally, islands don't interest me, but I can't let you have all the fun without me.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_25":"So, I'm coming too.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_26":"???","dialogue_summer_10001_1_27":"That logic doesn't compute.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_28":"Some people just invite themselves, don't they?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_29":"Been plotting a trip with the Omniguardian since last month, haven't you?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_30":"Cut it out!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_31":"You're up to something, I know it!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_32":"...","dialogue_summer_10001_1_33":"That's okay. The more, the merrier!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_34":"Let's get going then!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_35":"Oh, the sea breeze feels so good... I'm even more excited about this journey now!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_36":"Going by my limited seafaring experience... shouldn't we get a boat first?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_37":"If you know that, what are we still doing here?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_38":"...","dialogue_summer_10001_1_39":"I got this.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_40":"Quit bickering, you two. I've prepared for this, it's my hometown after all.","dialogue_summer_10001_1_41":"Watch closely. My little buddies will take us to our destination!","dialogue_summer_10001_1_42":"(Marina whistles, and several giant clams surface from the sea)","dialogue_summer_10001_1_43":"Can we really trust these \"little buddies\" of yours?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_44":"Come on. Where's your sense of adventure?","dialogue_summer_10001_1_45":"Of course, you can! Rest assured, folks, you're in good hands!","dialogue_summer_10101_0_1":"I go to him in haste and depart reluctantly.","dialogue_summer_10101_0_2":"With many little farewells.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_1":"Ah, the familiar scent... I'm finally home!","dialogue_summer_10101_1_2":"Let me introduce you all. This is Mandana Islands, located south of East Palmarius.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_3":"And beneath these islands lies the kingdom of us Merfolk.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_4":"Nice place, good for a vacation I suppose.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_5":"...I get your point, but shouldn't we check things out first?","dialogue_summer_10101_1_6":"How do we go underwater?","dialogue_summer_10101_1_7":"There's a special energy barrier underwater. We'll need to teleport from the islands.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_8":"Is this energy barrier meant to keep intruders out?","dialogue_summer_10101_1_9":"Exactly! It's been keeping us Merfolk safe for thousands of years.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_10":"Heh... Are you sure it's 100% foolproof?","dialogue_summer_10101_1_11":"...Well, that's exactly what I'm here to find out.","dialogue_summer_10101_1_12":"Let's focus on the immediate problem first!","dialogue_summer_10101_1_13":"We've got company!","dialogue_summer_10101_2_1":"Strange, animals here used to be so tame. Why are they acting like this now?","dialogue_summer_10101_2_2":"These are minor nuisances. I can ignore the occasional ambush from such weaklings.","dialogue_summer_10101_2_3":"Still, something doesn't feel right...","dialogue_summer_10101_2_4":"If I'm not mistaken, there are human footprints over there.","dialogue_summer_10101_2_5":"And not just that, there's also a boat and signs of a campfire in the distance.","dialogue_summer_10101_2_6":"Seems like someone was here not too long ago before we arrived...","dialogue_summer_10101_2_7":"Did they scare those animals, perhaps?","dialogue_summer_10101_2_8":"Let's stay alert, everyone.","dialogue_summer_10102_1_1":"This beach feels peaceful... Are you being paranoid, Marina?","dialogue_summer_10102_1_2":"I'm not sure... I hope I am.","dialogue_summer_10102_1_3":"Seeing the ocean this blue, don't you two feel the urge to take a dip?","dialogue_summer_10102_1_4":"Oh, I'm dying to change into my swimsuit...","dialogue_summer_10102_1_5":"Yeah, me too! But I didn't bring anything...","dialogue_summer_10102_1_6":"Well, I've got us covered!","dialogue_summer_10102_1_7":"Gentleman, we're about to change... You're not planning to watch, are you?","dialogue_summer_10102_1_8":"I'll turn around now.","dialogue_summer_10102_1_9":"(10 minutes later)","dialogue_summer_10103_1_1":"These swimsuits fit like a glove!","dialogue_summer_10103_1_2":"You've nailed the sizing. Feels like they're tailor-made!","dialogue_summer_10103_1_3":"Marina, your legs?","dialogue_summer_10103_1_4":"Marina, your tails?","dialogue_summer_10103_1_5":"We Merfolk can transform our tails into legs when we're on land. For ease of moving around.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_6":"I see...","dialogue_summer_10103_1_7":"Classic guys... always focusing on the wrong things.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_8":"Do you think he even noticed we changed into swimsuits?","dialogue_summer_10103_1_9":"Ah... you two look amazing in your outfits!","dialogue_summer_10103_1_10":"Omniguardian, what do you think?","dialogue_summer_10103_1_11":"I agree.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_12":"I've noticed for a while...","dialogue_summer_10103_1_13":"Okay, I'll forgive you since you're being nice.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_14":"On another note, I'm getting a bit hungry...","dialogue_summer_10103_1_15":"Let's find some food first.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_16":"Let's take a break.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_17":"Leave the foraging to me!","dialogue_summer_10103_1_18":"I can handle myself, Marina. I'll come with you.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_19":"Be careful out there.","dialogue_summer_10103_1_20":"Try not to get your clothes dirty, okay?","dialogue_summer_10104_1_1":"This should be enough for dinner. Let's find a spot to start a fire!","dialogue_summer_10104_1_2":"A picnic in the sea breeze sounds delightful!","dialogue_summer_10104_1_3":"Feels like a real vacation, doesn't it?","dialogue_summer_10104_1_4":"Doesn't look dangerous around here, at least.","dialogue_summer_10104_1_5":"I know a great spot, follow me!","dialogue_summer_10105_1_1":"Wow, with the mountains behind us and a great view of the sea, this spot is perfect!","dialogue_summer_10105_1_2":"I used to come here all the time before I left home, it's my secret hideaway!","dialogue_summer_10105_1_3":"Oh? Sounds like there's a story there.","dialogue_summer_10105_1_4":"I have a Merfolk friend who was ostracized by everyone because she was born different.","dialogue_summer_10105_1_5":"Whenever she was down, I'd bring her here to cheer her up.","dialogue_summer_10105_1_6":"It's been a long time since I've seen her... I wonder how she's doing now.","dialogue_summer_10105_1_7":"Maybe we'll run into her later.","dialogue_summer_10105_1_8":"Ahem, shall we eat?","dialogue_summer_10105_1_9":"Let's camp out here!","dialogue_summer_10105_1_10":"Alright, let me clear a space first.","dialogue_summer_10105_2_1":"All set!","dialogue_summer_10105_2_2":"Good job, my darling Marina... I'll make sure you get an extra serving later.","dialogue_summer_10106_1_1":"Hmm... seems like we've got some uninvited guests.","dialogue_summer_10106_1_2":"Probably just some critters attracted by the smell.","dialogue_summer_10106_1_3":"I'll take care of them.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_1":"Even though it's late, I'm not sleepy at all.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_2":"Same here.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_3":"You're missing home, aren't you?","dialogue_summer_10106_2_4":"The sound of the tide is so soothing. I haven't felt this peaceful in ages...","dialogue_summer_10106_2_5":"It's like the ocean is welcoming me home!","dialogue_summer_10106_2_6":"I've heard that Merfolk are known as the sirens of the sea...","dialogue_summer_10106_2_7":"I've heard the rumors too. Why not treat us to a Merfolk song?","dialogue_summer_10106_2_8":"Okay, let me give it a try!","dialogue_summer_10106_2_9":"...","dialogue_summer_10106_2_10":"...Sorry, I can't do it.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_11":"Why not?","dialogue_summer_10106_2_12":"What's wrong?","dialogue_summer_10106_2_13":"It's like a curse for us Merfolk... When we transform into human form, we can't sing our melodies.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_14":"Sorry to let you all down...","dialogue_summer_10106_2_15":"It's not your fault. No need to apologize.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_16":"Listening to the waves quietly isn't so bad either.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_17":"We'll join you.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_18":"Okay... thank you.","dialogue_summer_10106_2_19":"No matter how much time passes, there's no better music than the sound of the tide from the hometown.","dialogue_summer_10107_1_1":"(The night passes)","dialogue_summer_10107_1_2":"(A strange song is heard)","dialogue_summer_10107_1_3":"...What was that?!","dialogue_summer_10107_1_4":"Omniguardian, Dorabella, Aiushtha, wake up!","dialogue_summer_10107_1_5":"What's going on?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_6":"What's the matter, my darling Marina?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_7":"Didn't you hear that strange singing?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_8":"No.","dialogue_summer_10107_1_9":"Are you sure?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_10":"Huh? It's all quiet around here...","dialogue_summer_10107_1_11":"It was a singing voice that felt distant and ethereal, almost captivating...","dialogue_summer_10107_1_12":"That's odd. You guys didn't hear it?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_13":"If you're the only one hearing it, maybe it's a sound at a frequency only you can detect.","dialogue_summer_10107_1_14":"Could it be connected to your people?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_15":"That's a possibility!","dialogue_summer_10107_1_16":"Can you tell where it's coming from?","dialogue_summer_10107_1_17":"Let's go find out.","dialogue_summer_10107_1_18":"Yes! It's clearly coming from the depths of the island's rainforest.","dialogue_summer_10107_1_19":"Then let's get going!","dialogue_summer_10107_1_20":"Hold on, let's deal with the immediate problem first.","dialogue_summer_10201_0_1":"As the tide comes.","dialogue_summer_10201_0_2":"We caress each other.","dialogue_summer_10201_1_1":"Can you still hear the singing?","dialogue_summer_10201_1_2":"Yes! And it's getting clearer.","dialogue_summer_10201_1_3":"Seems like we're on the right track, though nothing's out of the ordinary so far...","dialogue_summer_10201_1_4":"That's what's most concerning.","dialogue_summer_10201_1_5":"That's what makes it troubling.","dialogue_summer_10201_1_6":"I agree with you there...","dialogue_summer_10201_1_7":"Mysterious singing on an unusually calm island, something must be off.","dialogue_summer_10201_1_8":"Don't let your guard down, everyone.","dialogue_summer_10201_1_9":"Right...","dialogue_summer_10201_1_10":"Let's get rid of these pesky little guys once and for all!","dialogue_summer_10202_1_1":"The scenery is becoming increasingly mesmerizing...","dialogue_summer_10202_1_2":"True, the view here keeps getting better and better.","dialogue_summer_10202_1_3":"It feels like a fairyland.","dialogue_summer_10202_1_4":"It feels like a dream.","dialogue_summer_10202_1_5":"Odd, did I forget what my homeland looked like? I never remember it being this beautiful.","dialogue_summer_10202_1_6":"And... the singing is fading.","dialogue_summer_10202_1_7":"Well, might as well enjoy the view while it lasts.","dialogue_summer_10203_1_1":"Something's off here.","dialogue_summer_10203_1_2":"Where are Dorabella and Aiushtha?","dialogue_summer_10203_1_3":"I knew something was not right!","dialogue_summer_10203_1_4":"Hey, stop! Who are you?","dialogue_summer_10203_1_5":"You being here... something's amiss!","dialogue_summer_10203_2_1":"Wait, you're the legendary Omniguardian {0}?","dialogue_summer_10203_2_2":"You've heard of me?","dialogue_summer_10203_2_3":"Yes.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_4":"Ah, it's just a misunderstanding then.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_5":"I'm Portia, a maritime explorer appointed by Queen Athena herself.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_6":"An explorer, huh? So you're here for an adventure?","dialogue_summer_10203_2_7":"You guessed it!","dialogue_summer_10203_2_8":"I ran low on supplies, so I thought I'd try my luck on this island.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_9":"Bad luck, it seems. I've been stuck in this illusion for three days now.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_10":"Illusion?","dialogue_summer_10203_2_11":"So that's what's going on.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_12":"I knew something was weird. I grew up on this island, and it's never looked like this!","dialogue_summer_10203_2_13":"So you're a native?","dialogue_summer_10203_2_14":"Yes, this is my hometown. I haven't been back in a long time, though...","dialogue_summer_10203_2_15":"So you're Merfolk, but that doesn't seem to be helping much right now.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_16":"This is not good.","dialogue_summer_10203_2_17":"Dorabella and Aiushtha...","dialogue_summer_10203_2_18":"Omniguardian, we need to find them quickly!","dialogue_summer_10203_2_19":"Lost some companions, have you?","dialogue_summer_10203_2_20":"Well, standing around isn't getting us anywhere. I'll help you look!","dialogue_summer_10204_2_1":"This illusion is massive. Feels like we're just going in circles!","dialogue_summer_10204_2_2":"Whoever's behind this is going to get a piece of my mind!","dialogue_summer_10204_2_3":"It's that singing...","dialogue_summer_10204_2_4":"I think I know what's going on...","dialogue_summer_10204_2_5":"That mysterious singing is definitely the problem!","dialogue_summer_10204_2_6":"Let me listen closely...","dialogue_summer_10204_2_7":"Don't know what you're talking about, but where are we going next?","dialogue_summer_10204_2_8":"There! The singing is coming from the north!","dialogue_summer_10204_2_9":"Let's go north, then!","dialogue_summer_10205_1_1":"We found them!","dialogue_summer_10205_1_2":"Uh... are these the legendary Valkyries?","dialogue_summer_10205_1_3":"One is passionately debating with a flower, and the other is lying in a petal counting stars. They look happy...","dialogue_summer_10205_1_4":"...You're wrong! Arcanum isn't like that at all!","dialogue_summer_10205_1_5":"Let me count your stars for you... Oh, you won't let me?","dialogue_summer_10205_1_6":"...","dialogue_summer_10205_1_7":"Ahem, let's snap them out of it.","dialogue_summer_10205_1_8":"Monsters incoming!","dialogue_summer_10205_1_9":"Let's deal with them first!","dialogue_summer_10205_2_1":"Finally, we've cleared the area...","dialogue_summer_10205_2_2":"Dorabella, Aiushtha, you guys okay?","dialogue_summer_10205_2_3":"Uh... cough, cough...","dialogue_summer_10205_2_4":"Ah, you're here...","dialogue_summer_10205_2_5":"You seemed quite engrossed.","dialogue_summer_10205_2_6":"What did you see in the illusion?","dialogue_summer_10205_2_7":"...I suggest you forget what you just saw!","dialogue_summer_10205_2_8":"I second that!","dialogue_summer_10205_2_9":"But wait, who's this?","dialogue_summer_10205_2_10":"Hahaha, I'm Portia, a world-traveling maritime explorer. Pleased to meet you!","dialogue_summer_10205_2_11":"Ah, an ally of the Empire.","dialogue_summer_10205_2_12":"Enough chit-chat. Let's find a way out of this illusion!","dialogue_summer_10206_1_1":"I'm losing my sense of direction... the singing is coming from everywhere now.","dialogue_summer_10206_1_2":"Let me think... I've tried all these directions these past few days and got nowhere.","dialogue_summer_10206_1_3":"There's one direction I haven't tried yet. Are you willing to take a gamble with me?","dialogue_summer_10206_1_4":"Of course.","dialogue_summer_10206_1_5":"Let's go, then.","dialogue_summer_10207_1_1":"I think we're on the right track... The source of the singing should be right ahead!","dialogue_summer_10207_1_2":"Incredible... There's a stone door here!","dialogue_summer_10207_1_3":"And it's marked with a massive Oath Ring.","dialogue_summer_10207_1_4":"Hey buddy, is your arm glowing?","dialogue_summer_10207_1_5":"I sense something.","dialogue_summer_10207_1_6":"I should be able to open it.","dialogue_summer_10207_1_7":"Fantastic! Let's get this over with and get out of this hellhole!","dialogue_summer_10207_2_1":"...","dialogue_summer_10207_2_2":"...","dialogue_summer_10207_2_3":"...","dialogue_summer_10207_2_4":"Can anyone explain what we're looking at?","dialogue_summer_10207_2_5":"These... these are the remains of Merfolk!","dialogue_summer_10207_2_6":"No... My people","dialogue_summer_10207_2_7":"(A strange singing fills the air)","dialogue_summer_10207_2_8":"Hold on, I think I hear it...","dialogue_summer_10207_2_9":"Yes, the singing... I hear it too.","dialogue_summer_10207_2_10":"Seriously, what is going on here?","dialogue_summer_10300_0_1":"When it withdraws.","dialogue_summer_10300_0_2":"I drop to his feet in prayer.","dialogue_summer_10301_1_1":"Anyway, let's check around.","dialogue_summer_10301_1_2":"...Alright...","dialogue_summer_10301_1_3":"Watch out, is dangerous!","dialogue_summer_10302_2_1":"These monsters are much stronger than the previous ones!","dialogue_summer_10302_2_2":"Obviously, it has to do with that \"big guy\" over there.","dialogue_summer_10302_2_3":"Marina, do you recognize this enormous skeleton?","dialogue_summer_10302_2_4":"I don't know...","dialogue_summer_10302_2_5":"How... how did the islands turn out like this?","dialogue_summer_10302_2_6":"Hey, you okay?","dialogue_summer_10302_2_7":"My darling Marina, you look really shaken up...","dialogue_summer_10302_2_8":"You're stating the obvious! Aiushtha, don't you have any empathy?","dialogue_summer_10302_2_9":"Let's take her away from here.","dialogue_summer_10302_2_10":"Alright, you got it.","dialogue_summer_10303_1_1":"Last wave. Almost done wiping them out.","dialogue_summer_10303_1_2":"No... trespassing...","dialogue_summer_10303_1_3":"Hey, hey. What's this?!","dialogue_summer_10303_1_4":"Intrusion... not allowed...!","dialogue_summer_10303_1_5":"Heh, just more freaks... Watch this!","dialogue_summer_10303_2_1":"You... you... daughters of the ocean... you...","dialogue_summer_10303_2_2":"Huh? They seem to have some consciousness.","dialogue_summer_10303_2_3":"They all have Merfolk tails... could these be Merfolk spirits?","dialogue_summer_10303_2_4":"Marina... pearl of the islands... You have returned...","dialogue_summer_10303_2_5":"You... How did you all end up like this?!","dialogue_summer_10303_2_6":"Where are the others...? What happened to the islands?!","dialogue_summer_10303_2_7":"A century ago, these waters were also invaded by the Abyss. Hydra was the oceanic lord who led the invasion.","dialogue_summer_10303_2_8":"We managed to seal its body here, but in doing so, we, the whole Merfolk clan, had to sacrifice our own bodies...","dialogue_summer_10303_2_9":"Now, we're long dead, only our souls remain to guard this place...","dialogue_summer_10303_2_10":"...No!","dialogue_summer_10303_2_11":"This can't be true... All my people...","dialogue_summer_10303_2_12":"Marina, don't be sad. This was our choice.","dialogue_summer_10303_2_13":"We're still guarding our home, just in a different form... And it's worth it.","dialogue_summer_10303_2_14":"(Everyone falls into a heavy silence following Marina)","dialogue_summer_10304_1_1":"Hold on, if this Hydra is sealed, why is there still such a powerful illusion?","dialogue_summer_10304_1_2":"About that... there's more to the story.","dialogue_summer_10304_1_3":"That's why we've been sending messages to our kin outside, telling them not to come back...","dialogue_summer_10304_1_4":"You mean... the calling I heard in my dreams?","dialogue_summer_10304_1_5":"I thought it was a cry for help from home...","dialogue_summer_10304_1_6":"Looks like you completely misunderstood.","dialogue_summer_10304_1_7":"So what's the deal with this illusion?","dialogue_summer_10304_1_8":"What's the hidden story?","dialogue_summer_10304_1_9":"Before we reveal the truth... let's see if you're really worthy.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_1":"Impressive. As expected of the Omniguardian of the Oath Ring...","dialogue_summer_10304_2_2":"We've... finally met our equals.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_3":"Now tell us the truth!","dialogue_summer_10304_2_4":"We managed to seal away Hydra's body, but his soul slipped away...","dialogue_summer_10304_2_5":"His soul now resides in a Merfolk, lurking beneath these island waters.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_6":"As long as his soul isn't destroyed, the illusion and decay here won't vanish.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_7":"Oh? That sounds intriguing.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_8":"Seems like there's going to be a new adventure!","dialogue_summer_10304_2_9":"I'm off to find him!","dialogue_summer_10304_2_10":"Marina... Hydra is extremely dangerous, you, ","dialogue_summer_10304_2_11":"We're not afraid.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_12":"This is what we're here for.","dialogue_summer_10304_2_13":"Alright, then... We'll do our best to assist you...","dialogue_summer_10304_2_14":"Thank you.","dialogue_summer_10305_1_1":"This is as far as I can take you.","dialogue_summer_10305_1_2":"From here, you'll find the Vortex Well leading to the ocean floor.","dialogue_summer_10305_1_3":"Jump in, and when you reach the deepest part of the ocean, you'll see him...","dialogue_summer_10305_1_4":"Great, let's go!","dialogue_summer_10305_1_5":"Thanks, everyone, for coming with me...","dialogue_summer_10305_1_6":"Mm... we knew what we signed up for.","dialogue_summer_10305_1_7":"Once we handle this, maybe we can take a little vacation?","dialogue_summer_10305_1_8":"For a maritime explorer like me, experiences like this are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!","dialogue_summer_10305_1_9":"Let's move.","dialogue_summer_10308_1_1":"That must be the vortex leading to the seal, right?","dialogue_summer_10308_1_2":"Let's see, damn these pesky fish!","dialogue_summer_10308_1_3":"Ha, told you there'd be plenty of little critters down here.","dialogue_summer_10308_2_1":"Going through here should take us straight to the ocean floor!","dialogue_summer_10308_2_2":"So... we just jump in?","dialogue_summer_10308_2_3":"(Marina takes a deep breath, leaps high into the air, and plunges into the vortex)","dialogue_summer_10308_2_4":"Our turn.","dialogue_summer_10308_2_5":"Here I go!","dialogue_summer_10308_2_6":"Heh, wait up!","dialogue_summer_10308_2_7":"Hey, don't leave me behind!","dialogue_summer_10400_0_1":"I may be weary.","dialogue_summer_10400_0_2":"But I shall never die.","dialogue_summer_10401_1_1":"So this is what's left of the once-great Merfolk kingdom, Atlantis...","dialogue_summer_10401_1_2":"To think it's reduced to ruins...","dialogue_summer_10401_1_3":"It must've been absolutely stunning back in the day.","dialogue_summer_10401_1_4":"This place was a beacon of beauty and grandeur, and the islands above were our haven.","dialogue_summer_10401_1_5":"What a loss...","dialogue_summer_10401_1_6":"Loss? Are you kidding? This is another epic chapter in my life as an adventurer!","dialogue_summer_10401_1_7":"...","dialogue_summer_10401_1_8":"If we manage to take down Hydra, who knows, maybe Atlantis could be rebuilt.","dialogue_summer_10401_1_9":"Let's focus on the monsters at hand first.","dialogue_summer_10403_1_1":"The deeper we go, the stronger these monsters seem to get.","dialogue_summer_10403_1_2":"Probably because they're closer to their master!","dialogue_summer_10403_1_3":"Just imagine how powerful Hydra must be...","dialogue_summer_10403_1_4":"Marina, are you ready?","dialogue_summer_10403_1_5":"Yes! I'm not backing down!","dialogue_summer_10405_1_1":"Who's that?!","dialogue_summer_10405_1_2":"Who are you?","dialogue_summer_10405_1_3":"Is that... a member of the Shark Clan?","dialogue_summer_10405_1_4":"In my experience, unexpected guests usually spell trouble...","dialogue_summer_10405_1_5":"Why did she go in there?","dialogue_summer_10405_1_6":"Let's follow her.","dialogue_summer_10406_2_1":"Where did that shark go?","dialogue_summer_10406_2_2":"I hate dilly-dallying!","dialogue_summer_10406_2_3":"For some reason, she looks familiar...","dialogue_summer_10406_2_4":"Is that her up ahead? Let's find out!","dialogue_summer_10407_1_1":"Heh... venturing into the ocean depths alone? You've got guts.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_2":"Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Lamia, and this is my home.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_3":"And I've been waiting for you for a while.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_4":"What do you mean by that? Could you be, ","dialogue_summer_10407_1_5":"You're looking for Hydra, right? His soul is in my staff.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_6":"Whoa, now that's a twist!","dialogue_summer_10407_1_7":"Hydra's soul is incredibly weak now, this is a golden opportunity to eliminate him.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_8":"I don't trust you.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_9":"You're up to something.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_10":"Wait, it's coming back to me, Lamia, it's you! My old friend!","dialogue_summer_10407_1_11":"Why are you here...? Do you know what happened to our people? Why didn't you help them?","dialogue_summer_10407_1_12":"Ha, the Merfolk had it coming!","dialogue_summer_10407_1_13":"Those jerks who used to bully me had to pay!","dialogue_summer_10407_1_14":"No, they didn't.","dialogue_summer_10407_1_15":"You're not the Lamia I know!","dialogue_summer_10408_1_1":"Still want to fight? I've only used a third of my power.","dialogue_summer_10408_1_2":"What the heck is she made of? How is she so strong?!","dialogue_summer_10408_1_3":"She's Hydra.","dialogue_summer_10408_1_4":"Hahaha, you've figured it out... Yes!","dialogue_summer_10408_1_5":"I'm Lamia, but I'm also Hydra... Our souls have long since merged!","dialogue_summer_10408_1_6":"No wonder she felt familiar... The power of the Abyss again!","dialogue_summer_10408_1_7":"I don't care if you're Lamia or Hydra... I will avenge my people!","dialogue_summer_10408_2_1":"Marina, you can't transform into your mermaid form near the seal. It will greatly limit your power.","dialogue_summer_10408_2_2":"But... we can help you.","dialogue_summer_10408_2_3":"No! If you do that, you will disappear forever!","dialogue_summer_10408_2_4":"We have no more attachments to this world, but you, you still have a future.","dialogue_summer_10408_2_5":"Marina, we'll transfer all our power to you. Accept our blessing...","dialogue_summer_10408_2_6":"Don't... Ah!!!","dialogue_summer_10408_2_7":"That glow... It's the power of Merfolk, isn't it?","dialogue_summer_10408_2_8":"...Lamia, this is the end of the line for you!","dialogue_summer_10408_2_9":"(Marina begins to sing in her human form)","dialogue_summer_10408_2_10":"What?! You've actually broken the mermaid curse!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_1":"Worthless... utterly worthless! Can't even deal with one little fish!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_2":"Oh? Hydra? Ha... So you really are a weak soul, huh?","dialogue_summer_10408_3_3":"Don't let him escape!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_4":"You've got nowhere to run! Eat my hook!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_5":"Well done!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_6":"Thank you!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_7":"We just have to destroy his soul, and this menace will be gone forever!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_8":"Let's do it!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_9":"(...)","dialogue_summer_10408_3_10":"It's all settled. Our vacation can finally begin.","dialogue_summer_10408_3_11":"I can finally leave this hellhole... I haven't slept in days!","dialogue_summer_10408_3_12":"Thanks for everything you did.","dialogue_summer_10408_3_13":"(Back at the camp)","dialogue_summer_10408_3_14":"The storm has finally passed.","dialogue_summer_10408_3_15":"Mhm.","dialogue_summer_10408_3_16":"The night sky is so beautiful tonight, and the sound of the tide is so calming…","dialogue_summer_10408_3_17":"I suddenly feel like singing...","dialogue_summer_10500_1_1":"This trip's been totally worth it!","dialogue_summer_10500_1_2":"Is that all you've got to say?","dialogue_summer_10500_1_3":"Hmm... and the island view isn't too bad either.","dialogue_summer_10500_1_4":"What's your real agenda?","dialogue_summer_10500_1_5":"Why did you really come here?","dialogue_summer_10500_1_6":"Someone's getting impatient... You really want to know, huh?","dialogue_summer_10500_1_7":"Spill it.","dialogue_summer_10500_1_8":"Yes.","dialogue_summer_10500_1_9":"They say if you take a special potion while a mermaid sings, you will become her faithful lover...","dialogue_summer_10500_1_10":"Are you satisfied with that answer?","dialogue_summer_10500_1_11":"So that's what happened back there?!","dialogue_summer_10500_1_12":"Did you take the potion when Marina was singing?","dialogue_summer_10500_1_13":"Shh, that's a secret.","dialogue_summer_10102_2_4":"Marina, your tail?","dialogue_main_10212_3_1":"What are you going to do to the Omniguardian?!","dialogue_main_10212_3_2":"If you want to harm him, you'll have to ask my sword first!","dialogue_main_10212_4_1":"The Council has no intention of being enemies with the Omniguardian. We're giving you this Sacred Galo as a gesture of goodwill.","dialogue_main_10212_4_2":"What plans does your Council have in mind?","dialogue_main_10212_4_3":"We haven't done anything. But the situation of the <color=#ffa352>Valor Valkyrie</color> doesn't look too good.","dialogue_main_10212_4_4":"Elune?","dialogue_main_10212_4_5":"As a favor to the Omniguardian, we'll also give you a message.","dialogue_main_10212_4_6":"Elune is under attack by the Abyss and is currently trapped in the <color=#ffa352>Foggy Jungle</color>.","dialogue_main_10212_4_7":"Farewell, Omniguardian.","dialogue_main_10212_4_8":"What?! Elune, she...","dialogue_main_10212_4_9":"Omniguardian, we should hurry to the Foggy Jungle.","dialogue_main_10212_4_10":"Let's head back to Mirlond first.","dialogue_main_10212_4_11":"I'll grant you the power to banish the Abyss.","dialogue_main_10212_4_12":"Understood... Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10001_1_1":"Thanks to your awakening, Mythoria is undergoing some remarkable changes, such as the <color=#ffa352>Eternal Gate</color>.","dialogue_season_10001_1_2":"The Eternal Gate?","dialogue_season_10001_1_3":"It's a portal that leads to <color=#ffa352>the Shattered Realm of Itheron</color>. And now, it has been reactivated.","dialogue_season_10001_1_4":"Through it, we can journey to Itheron and search for our lost <color=#ffa352>Eternal Relic</color>.","dialogue_season_10001_1_5":"This is also in preparation for the impending Abyss invasion.","dialogue_season_10001_1_6":"I can already feel the Relic I once wielded calling out to me.","dialogue_season_10001_1_7":"Then let's get going!","dialogue_season_10002_1_1":"Omniguardian, do you feel the Tome of Itheron?","dialogue_season_10002_1_2":"It's the supreme book that records the fate of all living beings. Through the Tome of Itheron, we can quickly locate the Relic.","dialogue_season_10002_1_3":"Only your power can resonate with the Tome of Itheron. Try establishing a connection with it!","dialogue_season_10101_1_1":"At the moment of forging the oath, an unchanging eternity is born.","dialogue_season_10101_1_2":"It is both tempest and ocean.","dialogue_season_10101_1_3":"It is... Ruler of the Zephyr.","dialogue_season_10101_1_4":"These are the ancient words inscribed upon the <color=#ffa352>Eternal Relic</color>. Have they triggered any memories for you?","dialogue_season_10101_1_5":"Unfortunately, no.","dialogue_season_10101_1_6":"I see... You don't even remember the very Eternal Relic that you once personally gifted me...","dialogue_season_10101_1_7":"Marina's hopeful gaze dims for a moment, but she quickly pulls herself together.","dialogue_season_10101_1_8":"It's fine. Restoring your memory doesn't just happen overnight.","dialogue_season_10101_1_9":"Anyway, let's find the Eternal Relic first. By the way...","dialogue_season_10101_1_10":"Marina surveys her surroundings, taking in the desolate landscape comprised of rubble and mist.","dialogue_season_10101_1_11":"Why did the Tome of Itheron teleport us to a place like this?","dialogue_season_10101_1_12":"There are no tempests or oceans here. It's certainly not the main battlefield of the Eternal Relic.","dialogue_season_10101_1_13":"I remember the Relic was lost in some ocean...","dialogue_season_10101_1_14":"Do you still hear its calling?","dialogue_season_10101_1_15":"Let me check again.","dialogue_season_10101_1_16":"Marina closes her eyes, carefully sensing the fluctuations of power from all around. After a moment, she opens her eyes and stares to the south.","dialogue_season_10101_1_17":"Following Marina's gaze, you can see faint outlines of structures in the distant mist.","dialogue_season_10101_1_18":"I've sensed the presence of the Eternal Relic within the mist. It's in that direction!","dialogue_season_10101_1_19":"Then let's go!","dialogue_season_10101_1_20":"Wait, Omniguardian! Besides the Relic's aura, I sense something else.","dialogue_season_10101_1_21":"They're getting closer to us!","dialogue_season_10101_2_1":"I'm surprised to see <color=#ffa352>Maru</color> here. These small creatures usually reside in the forest.","dialogue_season_10101_2_2":"They're usually too timid to leave their habitats.","dialogue_season_10101_2_3":"Now they dare to rush directly at us, and they seem to be afraid of something.","dialogue_season_10101_2_4":"I sense that too.","dialogue_season_10101_2_5":"Should we check it out? What they are afraid of might be connected to what we are looking for.","dialogue_season_10101_2_6":"Sure!","dialogue_season_10101_2_7":"Let's go have a look.","dialogue_season_10101_2_8":"I have a feeling that <color=#ffa352>retrieving the Eternal Relic</color> won't be as easy as we thought.","dialogue_season_10105_1_1":"What's that ahead...","dialogue_season_10105_1_2":"Hush!","dialogue_season_10105_1_3":"The two quickly hide behind a massive stone pillar, observing the unidentified creature ahead, which is armed and patrolling the area.","dialogue_season_10105_1_4":"Have we been away from <color=#ffa352>Itheron</color> for too long?","dialogue_season_10105_1_5":"What is that creature? I've never seen anything like it.","dialogue_season_10105_1_6":"Hmm... Its aura feels somewhat familiar, like the power of the Relic...","dialogue_season_10105_1_7":"What should we do now, Omniguardian?","dialogue_season_10105_1_8":"Let's try and get closer, but be cautious.","dialogue_season_10105_1_9":"All right.","dialogue_season_10105_1_10":"The two cautiously approach the target, using the scattered stone pillars as cover. Suddenly, the target turns, and its crimson gaze fixates on the stone pillar where the two are hiding.","dialogue_season_10105_1_11":"Omniguardian, it seems like it's spotted us!","dialogue_season_10105_1_12":"I thought I was being careful enough. Maybe it's just too alert?","dialogue_season_10105_1_13":"Look at its eyes. Something's not right.","dialogue_season_10105_1_14":"You're right. That ferocious yet vacant stare... Has it gone insane?","dialogue_season_10105_1_15":"It seems so.","dialogue_season_10105_1_16":"Rawwwrrrr!","dialogue_season_10105_1_17":"After staring at the stone pillar for a while, the creature suddenly roars. Soon there's a chorus of responsive cries from all around.","dialogue_season_10105_1_18":"Not good! It's calling for its companions!","dialogue_season_10105_2_1":"An exciting battle, but you need to be more careful.","dialogue_season_10105_2_2":"It's fortunate we have you. I can't believe this creature can still move with such severe wounds.","dialogue_season_10105_2_3":"They're the inhabitants of this place, though <color=#ffa352>corrupted</color> by some kind of power.","dialogue_season_10105_2_4":"This is a dangerous place. What brought you here?","dialogue_season_10105_2_5":"We're looking for something.","dialogue_season_10105_2_6":"Looking for something? In this <color=#ffa352>Corrupted Land</color>?","dialogue_season_10105_2_7":"You seem to know a lot about this place.","dialogue_season_10105_2_8":"I've been investigating the corruption here for some time, but clues have been scarce.","dialogue_season_10105_2_9":"I only know that the changes here are likely a result of some kind of ritual...","dialogue_season_10105_2_10":"The fierce woman seems to remember something and stops mid-sentence, scrutinizing Marina and the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10105_2_11":"Do I know you two? You look oddly familiar. Have we met before?","dialogue_season_10105_2_12":"I'm Marina, and he's {0}.","dialogue_season_10105_2_13":"Marina and {0}... {0}... the name sounds familiar. I think I've heard it somewhere before.","dialogue_season_10105_2_14":"Madeline ponders, but soon her expression changes to disbelief as she gazes at the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10105_2_15":"Do- do you know me?","dialogue_season_10105_2_16":"I am <color=#ffa352>Madeline of Dragoncliff</color>. Omniguardian, don't you remember me?","dialogue_season_10105_2_17":"I'm afraid not...","dialogue_season_10105_2_18":"How could this be...","dialogue_season_10105_2_19":"Something happened to the Omniguardian after the shattering of Itheron. He lost his memory.","dialogue_season_10105_2_20":"It's quite unexpected to see you here. I thought you left for Palmarius with the <color=#ffa352>Celestials</color>.","dialogue_season_10105_2_21":"Itheron is my home. It's not that easy for me to leave this place.","dialogue_season_10105_2_22":"And you're mistaken about something.","dialogue_season_10105_2_23":"What's that?","dialogue_season_10105_2_24":"I'm not just Madeline from the Seraphic Court; I'm also Madeline, the <color=#ffa352>Royal</color> under the Omniguardian's command back then.","dialogue_season_10105_2_25":"Omniguardian, you're here to find something in this mist, right?","dialogue_season_10105_2_26":"Yes.","dialogue_season_10105_2_27":"Madeline places her hand on her chest and slightly bows to the Omniguardian, a gesture of deep respect.","dialogue_season_10105_2_28":"Madeline the Dragoness, ready to serve you.","dialogue_season_10110_1_1":"So, you're here to find the Eternal Relic?","dialogue_season_10110_1_2":"Yes. Palmarius, the last continent we have left, is under constant threat from the Abyss.","dialogue_season_10110_1_3":"We must strengthen ourselves to prepare for any potential invasion.","dialogue_season_10110_1_4":"Luckily, the opening of the Eternal Gate led me to the Relic's lingering power.","dialogue_season_10110_1_5":"Well, the stench of the corruptive aura in this place is nauseating. Are you sure what you're looking for is here?","dialogue_season_10110_1_6":"I'm not positive, but tracking the remnants of its power has led me here.","dialogue_season_10110_1_7":"Then, let's be careful. We're approaching the gathering place of the Rotfiends.","dialogue_season_10110_1_8":"There aren't a lot of them. I believe we can deal with them rather quickly.","dialogue_season_10110_1_9":"Quickly it is!","dialogue_season_10110_1_10":"Yes!","dialogue_season_10110_2_1":"What happened to this place? Why are there so many Rotfiends here?","dialogue_season_10110_2_2":"When I stumbled upon this place during my travels in Itheron, it was already like this.","dialogue_season_10110_2_3":"Have you not ventured further to investigate?","dialogue_season_10110_2_4":"I entered a few times, but I quickly lost my way within the mist.","dialogue_season_10110_2_5":"Every time I walked out of it, I found myself back at the starting point.","dialogue_season_10110_2_6":"I could sense a powerful evil force brewing within that mist, but I couldn't get close.","dialogue_season_10110_2_7":"I see. The anomalies here seem to have a lot to do with the Eternal Relic that we seek.","dialogue_season_10110_2_8":"Why do you say that?","dialogue_season_10110_2_9":"I can feel it. The Relic is deep within the mist. Besides...","dialogue_season_10110_2_10":"Your experience of returning to the starting point also matches some characteristics of the Eternal Relic.","dialogue_season_10110_2_11":"Help... save me...","dialogue_season_10110_2_12":"Did you hear that?","dialogue_season_10110_2_13":"Yes. Someone is still alive here?","dialogue_season_10110_2_14":"We need to rescue him. It's from that direction, right?","dialogue_season_10110_2_15":"Wait! Not so fast...","dialogue_season_10115_1_1":"The trio rushes to the source of the voice and finds a \"monster\" surrounded by other monsters.","dialogue_season_10115_1_2":"The call for help comes from the one in the middle.","dialogue_season_10115_1_3":"He also carries an aura of corruption...","dialogue_season_10115_1_4":"He can still cry for help. That means he's still got some sanity left.","dialogue_season_10115_1_5":"Perhaps we can get some clues from him. Let's rescue him first.","dialogue_season_10115_2_1":"Save me... please save me...","dialogue_season_10115_2_2":"You're safe now.","dialogue_season_10115_2_3":"...Thank you...","dialogue_season_10115_2_4":"Who are you? Why were you attacked by those monsters?","dialogue_season_10115_2_5":"Who am I?... I'm an Ashen...","dialogue_season_10115_2_6":"Voooom!","dialogue_season_10115_2_7":"A strange sound echoes from the mist, and the knight in front lets out a guttural scream.","dialogue_season_10115_2_8":"Aaaahhh!","dialogue_season_10115_2_9":"Uh-oh! The corruption in him is getting stronger!","dialogue_season_10115_2_10":"I must... I have to find them!","dialogue_season_10115_2_11":"Don't even think about running!","dialogue_season_10115_2_12":"Don't... get in my way!","dialogue_season_10115_2_13":"Ugh!","dialogue_season_10115_2_14":"Watch out!","dialogue_season_10115_2_15":"We couldn't stop him. Why is he so powerful?","dialogue_season_10115_2_16":"Quick, let's go after him! He's our only lead. He must know something!","dialogue_season_10115_2_17":"Chase him!","dialogue_season_10201_1_1":"The group follows the frenzied knight to a land filled with a corruptive aura. The knight comes to a stop, and Marina and the others slow their pace as well.","dialogue_season_10201_1_2":"Where are you? Not here... not here.","dialogue_season_10201_1_3":"Who is he looking for?","dialogue_season_10201_1_4":"They must be very important to him, considering his current condition...","dialogue_season_10201_1_5":"Stay close!","dialogue_season_10201_1_6":"We won't lose him, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season_10201_1_7":"I'm not so sure...","dialogue_season_10201_1_8":"What's going on? This is...","dialogue_season_10201_1_9":"He's deliberately luring us into the midst of the monsters' gathering. Could this be a trap?","dialogue_season_10201_1_10":"But those monsters are also attacking him. Perhaps the people he's looking for are here.","dialogue_season_10201_1_11":"True. Let's help him.","dialogue_season_10201_2_1":"Have you found the people you're looking for?","dialogue_season_10201_2_2":"No... Not here... they're not here...","dialogue_season_10201_2_3":"We can help you look, but you need to tell us who you are first.","dialogue_season_10201_2_4":"I... I am... Hod... a member of the Ashen Knights.","dialogue_season_10201_2_5":"The <color=#ffa352>Ashen Knights</color>, you say? So, this place is the <color=#ffa352>Ashen Fortress</color>?","dialogue_season_10201_2_6":"The Ashen Knights?","dialogue_season_10201_2_7":"The Ashen Fortress?","dialogue_season_10201_2_8":"The Ashen Fortress was one of the fortresses that stood against the Abyss, and the Ashen Knights were its main defenders.","dialogue_season_10201_2_9":"But I remember the area where the Ashen Fortress is located disappeared after the shattering of Itheron.","dialogue_season_10201_2_10":"I thought it was completely destroyed by the Abyss invasion.","dialogue_season_10201_2_11":"This place... is the Ashen Fortress.","dialogue_season_10201_2_12":"The Abyss... didn't destroy us!","dialogue_season_10201_2_13":"So you're looking for your former comrades, the members of the Ashen Knights.","dialogue_season_10201_2_14":"Yes... my comrades... my companions... uh...","dialogue_season_10201_2_15":"He passed out... What should we do now? Keep going?","dialogue_season_10201_2_16":"We must keep going! Something definitely happened inside the fortress. Just look at Hod.","dialogue_season_10201_2_17":"I strongly suspect that the source of this corruption lies in the Ashen Fortress. Perhaps the Eternal Relic is also inside.","dialogue_season_10201_2_18":"Then let's move forward. And bring Hod with us.","dialogue_season_10201_2_19":"All right, I'll take care of Hod.","dialogue_season_10205_1_1":"Uh...","dialogue_season_10205_1_2":"You're awake. Are you feeling better?","dialogue_season_10205_1_3":"I... it hurts... my body feels like it's... decaying...","dialogue_season_10205_1_4":"Are these wounds from the monsters earlier? They seem to be getting worse.","dialogue_season_10205_1_5":"Let me give it a try.","dialogue_season_10205_1_6":"Are you going to use your Omnideus?","dialogue_season_10205_1_7":"The Omniguardian doesn't reply, but instead places his hand firmly against Hod's chest.","dialogue_season_10205_1_8":"As energy flows in, the emblem on the Omniguardian's arm, a symbol of the oath, emits a brilliant light.","dialogue_season_10205_1_9":"The rapidly decaying wounds gradually cease, and the look on Hod's face improves significantly.","dialogue_season_10205_1_10":"I missed this. The Omniguardian's power is still so comforting.","dialogue_season_10205_1_11":"Of course, the Omniguardian is the strongest!","dialogue_season_10205_1_12":"...","dialogue_season_10205_1_13":"The golden light shines in the mist, attracting a large group of corrupted creatures. They show a strong interest in such power.","dialogue_season_10205_1_14":"Are they drawn by the power of the Omnideus?","dialogue_season_10205_1_15":"It looks like the healing will take some time. We'll handle things here.","dialogue_season_10205_2_1":"Finally, the monsters have been eliminated. How's Hod doing?","dialogue_season_10205_2_2":"The corruption has been suppressed. But it seems like we can only suppress it, not completely eliminate it.","dialogue_season_10205_2_3":"The corruption here is constantly eroding him. Unless we thoroughly purify this place, it won't stop.","dialogue_season_10205_2_4":"Hod, relieved from his pain, struggles to stand up and looks at the Omniguardian and the others with gratitude.","dialogue_season_10205_2_5":"I'm feeling much better now. Thank you.","dialogue_season_10205_2_6":"What exactly happened here? How did the Ashen Fortress become like this?","dialogue_season_10205_2_7":"I don't know much, but you should know about the war that swept across the entire Itheron, right?","dialogue_season_10205_2_8":"Of course. I fought in that war.","dialogue_season_10205_2_9":"After the war, the Ashen Fortress drifted into the Primordial Sea and has been adrift since.","dialogue_season_10205_2_10":"We occasionally faced attacks from Abyss monsters, but in the name of the Ashen Knights, we had kept this place safe.","dialogue_season_10205_2_11":"But not long ago, the fortress was suddenly engulfed in a burst of intense light, and then the Ashen Fortress was shrouded in an <color=#ffa352>unexplained ritual power</color>.","dialogue_season_10205_2_12":"I was on duty outside the fortress and narrowly escaped it. But my comrades disappeared without a trace.","dialogue_season_10205_2_13":"I tried to find them but was attacked by monsters.","dialogue_season_10205_2_14":"Throughout it all, I tried my best to maintain my sanity, though I don't know how much time has passed.","dialogue_season_10205_2_15":"And then, I met all of you.","dialogue_season_10205_2_16":"So it's indeed some sort of ritual power... It seems the secrets are concealed within the fortress.","dialogue_season_10205_2_17":"Then let's go investigate.","dialogue_season_10210_1_1":"The trio surveys the monsters in the distance, then turns to look at Hod, who is resting and unaware of them.","dialogue_season_10210_1_2":"Marina gestures with her eyes to Madeline and the Omniguardian. The trio moves away from Hod and begins to speak quietly.","dialogue_season_10210_1_3":"More and more monsters are coming here...","dialogue_season_10210_1_4":"Not just their quantity. They also seem to have undergone some physical changes.","dialogue_season_10210_1_5":"Are you referring to the increasing corruption in their bodies?","dialogue_season_10210_1_6":"Yes, the fighting abilities of these monsters are probably stronger than those we encountered before.","dialogue_season_10210_1_7":"And...","dialogue_season_10210_1_8":"And what?","dialogue_season_10210_1_9":"Never mind... Let's hope something so cruel doesn't happen.","dialogue_season_10210_1_10":"Cruel... What do you mean?!","dialogue_season_10210_1_11":"We'll just have to wait and find out...","dialogue_season_10210_2_1":"From the fallen monsters, Marina and Madeline seem to be searching for something.","dialogue_season_10210_2_2":"Come and look! We found it!","dialogue_season_10210_2_3":"What is it?","dialogue_season_10210_2_4":"The extinguished embers, the flying ashes... just as I suspected. This is the insignia of the Ashen Knights.","dialogue_season_10210_2_5":"Insignia? So these monsters...","dialogue_season_10210_2_6":"Exactly, they are the corrupted Ashen Knights.","dialogue_season_10210_2_7":"It seems what happened here is quite clear.","dialogue_season_10210_2_8":"Yes, from a certain ritual, the corrupting power spread throughout the entire fortress.","dialogue_season_10210_2_9":"All the residents and the Ashen Knights were corrupted into monsters... Huh? Hod? Have you been listening?","dialogue_season_10210_2_10":"Is all of this... true?","dialogue_season_10210_2_11":"We found this on these monsters... no, on them.","dialogue_season_10210_2_12":"Madeline hands the insignia of the Ashen Knights Marina found to Hod.","dialogue_season_10210_2_13":"Hod holds the insignia and examines it carefully, standing still for a long time.","dialogue_season_10210_2_14":"So... my comrades have all turned into monsters...","dialogue_season_10210_2_15":"What I was searching for... has been lost...","dialogue_season_10210_2_16":"The corruption in Hod that was originally suppressed by the Omnideus starts to break through its seal—Hod's corruption is deepening.","dialogue_season_10210_2_17":"His will is collapsing!","dialogue_season_10210_2_18":"Snap out of it, Hod! We haven't entered the fortress yet. Perhaps there are other survivors in the fortress!","dialogue_season_10210_2_19":"If we can cleanse the corruption from the fortress, they might all recover!","dialogue_season_10210_2_20":"Yes... you're right... I can't... give up...","dialogue_season_10210_2_21":"Let's go. Quickly!","dialogue_season_10210_2_22":"Hod staggers and moves quickly towards the distant shadow of the structure shrouded in mist.","dialogue_season_10210_2_23":"The three of them exchange glances and fall silent, following closely.","dialogue_season_10215_1_1":"After a long journey, the group finally arrives at the Ashen Fortress.","dialogue_season_10215_1_2":"But at that moment, Hod suddenly collapses in front of the fortress gate.","dialogue_season_10215_1_3":"Hod!","dialogue_season_10215_1_4":"The corruptive aura here is too strong. The suppressive power of the Omnideus had already been broken by corruption.","dialogue_season_10215_1_5":"And for quite some time...","dialogue_season_10215_1_6":"He endured the corruption all the way to this point?","dialogue_season_10215_1_7":"Yes... Omniguardian, can you try suppressing his corrupted wounds again?","dialogue_season_10215_1_8":"I'll give it a try.","dialogue_season_10215_1_9":"No need... I haven't seen any survivors on this journey...","dialogue_season_10215_1_10":"In the end, I'll become like them, too...","dialogue_season_10215_1_11":"Kill me... Let me die as the last Ashen Knight...","dialogue_season_10215_1_12":"...","dialogue_season_10215_1_13":"Madeline has difficulty accepting this, hesitating to respond. Hod groans, and his body rapidly succumbs to corruption.","dialogue_season_10215_1_14":"Madeline! Danger!","dialogue_season_10215_1_15":"Quick... kill me!","dialogue_season_10215_2_1":"After a long while...","dialogue_season_10215_2_2":"Madeline stands before the grave she personally dug, using her fingers to carve onto the gravestone.","dialogue_season_10215_2_3":"The Last Ashen Knight","dialogue_season_10215_2_4":"Hod","dialogue_season_10215_2_5":"He was a great warrior.","dialogue_season_10215_2_6":"Yes, he was a great knight who guarded the fortress even without the help of others.","dialogue_season_10215_2_7":"Are you okay?","dialogue_season_10215_2_8":"I'm fine... I have something more important to do.","dialogue_season_10215_2_9":"Aren't you coming with us?","dialogue_season_10215_2_10":"They... have shown me the way, and I need to complete my mission.","dialogue_season_10215_2_11":"Madeline walks away in silence, but she sees the Omniguardian blocking her path.","dialogue_season_10215_2_12":"Omniguardian, you..","dialogue_season_10215_2_13":"Let's go in together.","dialogue_season_10215_2_14":"I won't just stand by.","dialogue_season_10215_2_15":"But aren't you looking for the Relic?","dialogue_season_10215_2_16":"It's not a conflict, and I can sense that the Eternal Relic is inside the fortress.","dialogue_season_10215_2_17":"Perhaps our goals are the same.","dialogue_season_10215_2_18":"I understand how you feel, but I still hope you can take a rest.","dialogue_season_10215_2_19":"Being fully prepared will help us deal with future uncertainties.","dialogue_season_10215_2_20":"All right...","dialogue_season_10215_3_1":"Who was that?","dialogue_season_10215_3_2":"You would've recognized her if you hadn't lost your memory.","dialogue_season_10215_3_3":"She is... <color=#ffa352>Ariana, the Night Huntress</color> of the Demonic Realm!","dialogue_season_10301_1_1":"The following is a memory buried within Madeline's heart.","dialogue_season_10301_1_2":"At that time, Itheron had not yet shattered, and Mirlond had still been prosperous.","dialogue_season_10301_1_3":"Madeline, a genius among the Dragon Clan, strolled through the bustling streets. This was her first visit to the Omniguardian's city.","dialogue_season_10301_1_4":"Wow, this is the Omniguardian's city! It's so different from the frigid Dragoncliff!","dialogue_season_10301_1_5":"Are you... the Divine from Dragoncliff?","dialogue_season_10301_1_6":"You've heard of me?","dialogue_season_10301_1_7":"Of course! You're the <color=#ffa352>Dragoness</color>, a fearless champion of justice!","dialogue_season_10301_1_8":"You have our support! The Omniguardian and everyone else will support you as a new Royal!","dialogue_season_10301_1_9":"Hahaha... I won't let you guys down!","dialogue_season_10301_1_10":"Amid the friendly gazes of the people, Madeline slips away from the crowd.","dialogue_season_10301_1_11":"Wow... the people of Mirlond are so enthusiastic!","dialogue_season_10301_1_12":"Huh? What's going on?","dialogue_season_10301_1_13":"Get her! She's stolen the Terra Crystal meant for the Royals!","dialogue_season_10301_1_14":"Is that so? Leave her to me!","dialogue_season_10301_1_15":"Madeline spreads her wings and soars over the crowd, landing in front of the thief.","dialogue_season_10301_1_16":"Hand it over. You can't escape now!","dialogue_season_10301_1_17":"The Herald of Justice from Dragoncliff, I see. Always meddling in others' business!","dialogue_season_10301_2_1":"Your current power falls short if you want to help the weak.","dialogue_season_10301_2_2":"You...","dialogue_season_10301_2_3":"In a world like this, isn't it all about power?","dialogue_season_10301_2_4":"Do you want this?","dialogue_season_10301_2_5":"The thief dangles the Terra Crystal. Then, with a sinister smile, she greedily absorbs its power.","dialogue_season_10301_2_6":"You!","dialogue_season_10301_2_7":"Now, it's nothing more than a useless stone. Take it.","dialogue_season_10301_2_8":"The thief tosses the powerless crystal to Madeline. She catches it.","dialogue_season_10301_2_9":"When she looks up again, the thief has vanished.","dialogue_season_10301_2_10":"Ugh!","dialogue_season_10301_2_11":"The Herald of Justice... is not that impressive.","dialogue_season_10301_2_12":"Madeline, is this your history with Ariana?","dialogue_season_10301_2_13":"Yes, although I didn't understand why you included her among the Royals.","dialogue_season_10301_2_14":"I could never accept being associated with someone who values power above all else.","dialogue_season_10301_2_15":"Afterward, with the Abyss invasion and the falling apart of the Royals, I never saw her again.","dialogue_season_10301_2_16":"...","dialogue_season_10301_2_17":"Clearly, she can navigate through the mist with ease. She's undoubtedly connected to the corruption ritual.","dialogue_season_10301_2_18":"Yes, as long as we find her, we're not far from the truth.","dialogue_season_10301_2_19":"Hod, your death won't be in vain...","dialogue_season_10305_1_1":"Still no survivors here.","dialogue_season_10305_1_2":"I've observed this place. The level of corruption here is many times higher than the outside.","dialogue_season_10305_1_3":"Even we can be affected by the corruption if we stay here for too long.","dialogue_season_10305_1_4":"There... won't be a second Hod here.","dialogue_season_10305_1_5":"To find Ariana in an environment like this... Omniguardian, do you have any good ideas?","dialogue_season_10305_1_6":"Through the ritual.","dialogue_season_10305_1_7":"Are you suggesting that since we've established Ariana's connection to the ritual, we can find her by finding the ritual?","dialogue_season_10305_1_8":"It's a feasible plan, but the cunning Ariana won't make it easy for us to locate the ritual.","dialogue_season_10305_1_9":"Let's try it your way first, Omniguardian. Maybe it'll yield unexpected results.","dialogue_season_10305_2_1":"As the corrupted creatures die, Marina closes her eyes to sense the energy flow within them. After a while, she opens her eyes.","dialogue_season_10305_2_2":"Hmm...","dialogue_season_10305_2_3":"What's going on?","dialogue_season_10305_2_4":"Somehow, the power of these corrupted creatures seems to be connected to a deeper part of the fortress.","dialogue_season_10305_2_5":"We already knew that.","dialogue_season_10305_2_6":"We originally thought that this corruption was the result of some ritual power dispersing, but it seems that's not the case.","dialogue_season_10305_2_7":"Why do you say that?","dialogue_season_10305_2_8":"The power of the corrupted creatures has disappeared. Something, or someone, used a ritual to absorb and consume the power.","dialogue_season_10305_2_9":"Which means...","dialogue_season_10305_2_10":"Which means that the knights and the residents of the Ashen Fortress were merely used to feed and nurture the corruption.","dialogue_season_10305_2_11":"It must be Ariana! Only someone obsessed with power would do such a thing!","dialogue_season_10305_2_12":"We must stop her!","dialogue_season_10305_2_13":"Madeline! Madeline! Wait for us!","dialogue_season_10305_2_14":"Let's catch up.","dialogue_season_10310_1_1":"The group arrives at an open area with intricate ritual symbols etched into the ground.","dialogue_season_10310_1_2":"Is this the location of the corruption ritual?","dialogue_season_10310_1_3":"You managed to follow me here, after all.","dialogue_season_10310_1_4":"Ariana!","dialogue_season_10310_1_5":"Don't be so impulsive!","dialogue_season_10310_1_6":"Watch out for traps!","dialogue_season_10310_1_7":"Ariana emerges from the shadows. Her crimson scythe gleams with a sinister light as the group cautiously readies themselves.","dialogue_season_10310_1_8":"Worried about traps, are you?","dialogue_season_10310_1_9":"After all these years, you've gone weak, Madeline.","dialogue_season_10310_1_10":"What did you say?!","dialogue_season_10310_1_11":"Mariana struggles to contain her anger and is about to charge, but Ariana doesn't spare her a glance.","dialogue_season_10310_1_12":"Ariana turns to the Omniguardian and gives a slight nod in greeting.","dialogue_season_10310_1_13":"It's been a long time, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10310_1_14":"For years, I followed your teachings, searching for true power. And now, I've found it.","dialogue_season_10310_1_15":"But I never thought that as I was on the brink of success, you and this idiot would come to stop me.","dialogue_season_10310_1_16":"True power?","dialogue_season_10310_1_17":"My teachings?","dialogue_season_10310_1_18":"You seem confused, but that's all right. In just a moment, you'll see how mighty the power I'm pursuing truly is.","dialogue_season_10310_1_19":"Something's wrong. She's just stalling for time.","dialogue_season_10310_1_20":"You just realized that? It's already... too late!","dialogue_season_10310_2_1":"While the group is stuck in battle, Ariana has somehow made her way to the side of the ritual array.","dialogue_season_10310_2_2":"She gently claps her hands as she watches the battle unfold, and her chains emit a crisp jingle.","dialogue_season_10310_2_3":"You're still as impressive as ever, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10310_2_4":"Your scheme will be shattered! Surrender, Ariana!","dialogue_season_10310_2_5":"A naive soul like you has truly wasted your talents.","dialogue_season_10310_2_6":"Your goal is to destroy the ritual, isn't it?","dialogue_season_10310_2_7":"I'll help you with that!","dialogue_season_10310_2_8":"Ariana suddenly swings her scythe, and the ritual array filled with tremendous power crumbles upon her attack.","dialogue_season_10310_2_9":"A powerful force erupts from the ritual array for a brief moment before being devoured by an unknown entity.","dialogue_season_10310_2_10":"The power wasn't consumed by her. This... this is a <color=#ffa352>Dual Ritual</color>?","dialogue_season_10310_2_11":"What? Have you had a second ritual hidden all along?","dialogue_season_10310_2_12":"Cunning has always been synonymous with us Demons in the eyes of you Divines, hasn't it?","dialogue_season_10310_2_13":"It's time to end this. Omniguardian, brace yourself. You're about to witness a formidable Ariana.","dialogue_season_10310_2_14":"Ariana's body gradually vanishes into the shadows, leaving the scene.","dialogue_season_10310_2_15":"Ariana! Stop right there!","dialogue_season_10310_2_16":"She's gone, but I know where she's headed.","dialogue_season_10310_2_17":"Follow me!","dialogue_season_10315_1_1":"Following Marina's guidance, they finally catch up with the elusive figure.","dialogue_season_10315_1_2":"I can't believe you managed to chase me here.","dialogue_season_10315_1_3":"You can't escape now!","dialogue_season_10315_1_4":"Don't make any more mistakes, Ariana. I know what you're trying to do.","dialogue_season_10315_1_5":"Oh? Let's hear it.","dialogue_season_10315_1_6":"A Dual Ritual means there are two cores, and one of them has been destroyed by you.","dialogue_season_10315_1_7":"As for the other one, it should be the <color=#ffa352>Eternal Relic, Zephyr Spear</color>.","dialogue_season_10315_1_8":"Marina continues her account. Ariana, while showing no signs of approval, gestures for her to proceed.","dialogue_season_10315_1_9":"You used the first ritual to corrupt the entire fortress, harnessing the essence of those lives for the power of corruption.","dialogue_season_10315_1_10":"When they die, the power of corruption is devoured by the second ritual. As the core of the second ritual,","dialogue_season_10315_1_11":"the Eternal Relic bears this power, then eventually becomes your so-called \"true power.\"","dialogue_season_10315_1_12":"Ariana remains silent for a long time before finally applauding, her gaze approving.","dialogue_season_10315_1_13":"Most of what you said is correct. However...","dialogue_season_10315_1_14":"Forget it. It's meaningless saying all of this now—the ritual is nearly complete.","dialogue_season_10315_1_15":"You won't succeed! You're staying here today!","dialogue_season_10315_1_16":"You can always try.","dialogue_season_10315_2_1":"You truly live up to your reputation as a dragon knight from Dragoncliff, a beacon of hope for the people.","dialogue_season_10315_2_2":"If I had your talents, maybe...","dialogue_season_10315_2_3":"Enough with the self-pity!","dialogue_season_10315_2_4":"I've shed much blood and sweat in my quest for justice. What does talent even represent?","dialogue_season_10315_2_5":"It represents being alive.","dialogue_season_10315_2_6":"You know nothing, Madeline.","dialogue_season_10315_2_7":"Is this your reason for using the Ashen Fortress and those lives for your ritual?","dialogue_season_10315_2_8":"It's laughable! I'll make sure justice is served for those who've perished!","dialogue_season_10315_2_9":"Justice, huh?","dialogue_season_10315_2_10":"I don't want to argue with you any longer. You can't stop me.","dialogue_season_10315_2_11":"What have you been through?","dialogue_season_10315_2_12":"To this day, I'm still grateful to you, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10315_2_13":"But I have no way back... This time, it's either life or...","dialogue_season_10315_2_14":"Try to stop me, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10401_1_1":"Weakness is a sin.","dialogue_season_10401_1_2":"Ariana, dressed in tattered clothes, sits on the side of the road in the Demonic Realm. Soon, a shadow looms over her.","dialogue_season_10401_1_3":"She instinctively looks up, gazing at the figure that blocks the sunlight.","dialogue_season_10401_1_4":"\"Snap!\"","dialogue_season_10401_1_5":"Filthy dark elf, who gave you permission to rest here?","dialogue_season_10401_1_6":"Weakness is a sin.","dialogue_season_10401_1_7":"Endure.","dialogue_season_10401_1_8":"Hmph, you've only stolen this much this whole time? What use are you?","dialogue_season_10401_1_9":"\"Snap!\"","dialogue_season_10401_1_10":"Weakness is a sin.","dialogue_season_10401_1_11":"Endure.","dialogue_season_10401_1_12":"Endure.","dialogue_season_10401_1_13":"They say a big shot arrived in the Demonic Realm recently, rumored to be carrying a legendary rune.","dialogue_season_10401_1_14":"Steal it, and I'll spare you, grant you freedom.","dialogue_season_10401_1_15":"Weakness is a sin.","dialogue_season_10401_1_16":"Freedom belongs to the mighty.","dialogue_season_10401_1_17":"A thief?! Capture her!","dialogue_season_10401_1_18":"Catch me? If you can!","dialogue_season_10401_2_1":"Ariana sprints away from the guards who have surrounded her and makes a break for the distance.","dialogue_season_10401_2_2":"However, after covering some ground, she notices a figure blocking her path ahead.","dialogue_season_10401_2_3":"Why did you steal the rune?","dialogue_season_10401_2_4":"...","dialogue_season_10401_2_5":"Are you seeking power?","dialogue_season_10401_2_6":"Weakness is a sin.","dialogue_season_10401_2_7":"Freedom belongs to the mighty.","dialogue_season_10401_2_8":"I... want power.","dialogue_season_10401_2_9":"But the rune... It's not true power. Only...","dialogue_season_10401_2_10":"Only what?","dialogue_season_10401_2_11":"What is true power?","dialogue_season_10401_2_12":"You can have the rune. I hope you find true power.","dialogue_season_10401_2_13":"With that, the figure turns and walks away. Ariana watches until tears blur her vision.","dialogue_season_10405_1_1":"The group arrives at the heart of the fortress. In the distance, the Eternal Relic, shimmering with corruptive energy, pulsates uneasily.","dialogue_season_10405_1_2":"We've found it, the <color=#ffa352>Zephyr Spear</color>.","dialogue_season_10405_1_3":"How did the Relic turn into this?","dialogue_season_10405_1_4":"It's been corrupted. This Eternal Relic symbolizes both tempest and ocean.","dialogue_season_10405_1_5":"During the corruption, the power of the Relic scattered.","dialogue_season_10405_1_6":"I believe it's the reason behind the mist outside the Ashen Fortress.","dialogue_season_10405_1_7":"I remember now! One of its powers is to disorient people in a storm.","dialogue_season_10405_1_8":"That explains why I was lost in that mist.","dialogue_season_10405_1_9":"So, what now? Can we stop her?","dialogue_season_10405_1_10":"Marina closes her eyes and lets out a soft, resonant hum, trying to connect with the distant Relic. After a while, she stops.","dialogue_season_10405_1_11":"The Relic isn't fully corrupted yet.","dialogue_season_10405_1_12":"If we can get to it and sever its connection to the ritual, there's still hope.","dialogue_season_10405_1_13":"What are we waiting for, then?","dialogue_season_10405_1_14":"First, let's deal with these foes.","dialogue_season_10405_2_1":"As the last corrupted creature falls, Madeline and the others immediately rush to the Relic.","dialogue_season_10405_2_2":"She's still trying to delay us with these corrupted creatures!","dialogue_season_10405_2_3":"Don't worry. She won't succeed.","dialogue_season_10405_2_4":"If we successfully retrieve the Relic, then these corrupted creatures...","dialogue_season_10405_2_5":"Unfortunately, they can never return to how they were. They've become too deeply corrupted.","dialogue_season_10405_2_6":"Once the power is withdrawn, they'll immediately perish.","dialogue_season_10405_2_7":"...","dialogue_season_10405_2_8":"Damn it!","dialogue_season_10410_1_1":"Do you want power?","dialogue_season_10410_1_2":"I want power.","dialogue_season_10410_1_3":"Then go to the Ashen Fortress. There, you'll find what you desire.","dialogue_season_10410_1_4":"Who are you?","dialogue_season_10410_1_5":"Who I am doesn't matter. What matters is... do you want to break free from your past weakness?","dialogue_season_10410_1_6":"I... Of course...","dialogue_season_10410_1_7":"Then go. I know deep down, you have a good soul.","dialogue_season_10410_1_8":"There's nothing wrong with seeking power. Go.","dialogue_season_10410_1_9":"I won't go. I'll find my own power!","dialogue_season_10410_1_10":"Is that so? But I believe you will go.","dialogue_season_10410_1_11":"...","dialogue_season_10410_1_12":"When the Omniguardian and the others arrive at the Relic, Ariana is already standing before it, seemingly lost in thought.","dialogue_season_10410_1_13":"What's she trying to do?","dialogue_season_10410_1_14":"Does she want to absorb the power directly from the Relic?","dialogue_season_10410_1_15":"Omniguardian, are you finally here to stop me?","dialogue_season_10410_1_16":"That's not true power!","dialogue_season_10410_1_17":"...","dialogue_season_10410_1_18":"Have you finally remembered me, Omniguardian?","dialogue_season_10410_1_19":"You know the Omniguardian lost his memory?","dialogue_season_10410_1_20":"I guessed. I figured the Omniguardian would never forget me—the thief who stole his rune.","dialogue_season_10410_1_21":"I only remember fragments.","dialogue_season_10410_1_22":"After reactivating the oath, the Omniguardian fell into a deep sleep, losing his memories.","dialogue_season_10410_1_23":"I see...","dialogue_season_10410_1_24":"So many years have passed. You've all changed...","dialogue_season_10410_1_25":"Only I, for the sake of power, for the sake of becoming stronger, for the sake of surviving, have never changed.","dialogue_season_10410_1_26":"Saying this, Ariana resolutely approaches the Relic and starts absorbing its power before the ritual is complete.","dialogue_season_10410_1_27":"There are intense energy fluctuations all around. One corrupted creature after another is drawn to this place.","dialogue_season_10410_1_28":"No, stop!","dialogue_season_10410_1_29":"Ariana, you... are weak!","dialogue_season_10410_1_30":"Hurry, stop her!","dialogue_season_10410_2_1":"The Omniguardian is the first to approach Ariana but is forcefully pushed back by a tremendous surge of power.","dialogue_season_10410_2_2":"Omniguardian!","dialogue_season_10410_2_3":"She...","dialogue_season_10410_2_4":"No! The energy she's absorbing has exceeded her limit!","dialogue_season_10410_2_5":"At this rate...","dialogue_season_10415_1_1":"Seeing Ariana in this state, the Omniguardian slowly but resolutely steps forward.","dialogue_season_10415_1_2":"Omniguardian?","dialogue_season_10415_1_3":"Let's fight.","dialogue_season_10415_1_4":"All right! I believe in the Omniguardian. We won't lose!","dialogue_season_10415_2_1":"I lost, Omniguardian...","dialogue_season_10415_2_2":"...","dialogue_season_10415_2_3":"I always... always hoped you could stop me.","dialogue_season_10415_2_4":"Robbing, stealing, betraying, doing anything to gain enough power to survive. I've done it all.","dialogue_season_10415_2_5":"In my pursuit of power, I gradually lost my way. You're right, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10415_2_6":"That was not true power.","dialogue_season_10415_2_7":"I'm sorry, Madeline.","dialogue_season_10415_2_8":"You...","dialogue_season_10415_2_9":"The Dual Ritual wasn't my doing. I had no intention of causing the tragedy of the Ashen Fortress.","dialogue_season_10415_2_10":"When I arrived here, those knights were already corrupted.","dialogue_season_10415_2_11":"I had intended to leave this place, but... the voice within me told me to stay. I... couldn't bear to leave.","dialogue_season_10415_2_12":"Heh, it wasn't you? Do you really think I'd believe that?","dialogue_season_10415_2_13":"It probably wasn't her after all. This kind of ritual requires a massive amount of magic, something Ariana doesn't possess.","dialogue_season_10415_2_14":"Then who could it be?","dialogue_season_10415_2_15":"I don't know. The face of that mysterious person was always shrouded in shadow.","dialogue_season_10415_2_16":"The mysterious person?","dialogue_season_10415_2_17":"I was seriously injured at the time. It was him who saved me...","dialogue_season_10415_2_18":"Did he tell you about the power here?","dialogue_season_10415_2_19":"Yes.","dialogue_season_10415_2_20":"Who could that be?","dialogue_season_10415_2_21":"I find it hard to believe you.","dialogue_season_10415_2_22":"Regardless, I won't forgive you, at least not now.","dialogue_season_10415_2_23":"After all, you used the power of those lost lives. Now, you know what you have to do.","dialogue_season_10415_2_24":"... Thank you.","dialogue_season_10416_1_1":"The four of them return to Mythoria through the Eternal Gate. Ariana also finds her place in Mirlond.","dialogue_season_10416_1_2":"The Eternal Gate falls silent, and everything in Mythoria appears peaceful and tranquil, just like the glorious era a thousand years ago.","dialogue_season_10416_1_3":"Those from the Demonic Realm dared to treat you like this?","dialogue_season_10416_1_4":"This is how things are in the Demonic Realm. I had no choice from the beginning.","dialogue_season_10416_1_5":"That's also why I envy you.","dialogue_season_10416_1_6":"You think I have it easy? Carrying such expectations, I also couldn't abandon them from the start.","dialogue_season_10416_1_7":"Maybe... Anyway, I'll seek redemption for my actions.","dialogue_season_10416_1_8":"Omniguardian, do you remember what you once told me?","dialogue_season_10416_1_9":"About what?","dialogue_season_10416_1_10":"About what <color=#ffa352>true power</color> really is...","dialogue_season_10416_1_11":"The Omniguardian recalls the images that flash through his mind and then looks at the hopeful faces around him. After a long pause, he answers.","dialogue_season_10416_1_12":"Maybe the Synergies between us are the true power.","dialogue_season_10416_1_13":"Indeed... To be defeated by such power isn't so bad.","dialogue_season_10416_1_14":"You can also obtain this kind of power, can't you?","dialogue_season_10416_1_15":"Yes, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10416_1_16":"In the ruined ritual altar, a dark figure gradually emerges from the void.","dialogue_season_10416_1_17":"He looks around, then lets out a cold laugh.","dialogue_season_10416_1_18":"I thought I could cultivate a new Abyss Lord.","dialogue_season_10416_1_19":"As expected, here you are, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season_10416_1_20":"Hahahahahaha...","dialogue_season_10416_1_21":"This attempt ends for now, Omniguardian. Just wait.","dialogue_season_10416_1_22":"In the near future, I'll give you and your oath a memorable lesson.","dialogue_main_10304_1_1":"Where is Elune... I'm praying her situation isn't too dire!","dialogue_main_10304_1_2":"As they speak, suddenly a faint roar echoes from not far away, causing the ground to tremble slightly.","dialogue_main_10304_1_3":"Everyone looks around alertly as a somewhat unfamiliar old friend suddenly appears with a shield.","dialogue_main_10304_1_4":"Be careful up ahead, friends.","dialogue_main_10304_1_5":"Some Magimons from the Abyss are chasing me. You should find somewhere to hide.","dialogue_main_10304_1_6":"<color=#ffa352>Lord Osse</color>!","dialogue_main_10304_1_7":"When faced with an enemy, a warrior will always choose to confront it head-on.","dialogue_main_10304_1_8":"Come on, let's go together!","dialogue_main_10304_2_1":"Greetings, Omniguardian, Valkyrie, Osse extends his greetings to all.","dialogue_main_10304_2_2":"Have you come here in search of someone?","dialogue_main_10304_2_3":"We're here for <color=@82>Elune</color>.","dialogue_main_10304_2_4":"Sounds like you know something... Do you perhaps have any news of her?","dialogue_main_10304_2_5":"Yes, as Guardian of the Woodland, I keep a close watch on every inch of this place.","dialogue_main_10304_2_6":"Make haste and head to her rescue. She's been locked in a <color=#ffa352>cage deep in the Jungle</color>.","dialogue_main_10304_2_7":"What?!","dialogue_main_10304_2_8":"Come with me quickly.","dialogue_main_10307_1_1":"It seems that in the <color=#ffa352>center of the iron cage</color>, Lady Elune is imprisoned!","dialogue_main_10307_1_2":"How dare they treat a Valkyrie like that?!","dialogue_main_10307_1_3":"...Unforgivable! If there's anything that angers me more than poachers, it's cages!","dialogue_main_10307_1_4":"Fueled by anger, everyone tries to approach the cage, but an unseen force keeps repelling them.","dialogue_main_10307_1_5":"In the cage, Elune buries her head deep in her tightly closed wings, seemingly too terrified to face reality.","dialogue_main_10307_1_6":"How do we open it?","dialogue_main_10307_1_7":"We can't get close.","dialogue_main_10307_1_8":"There's a mechanism up ahead, try that.","dialogue_main_10307_1_9":"Eluller steps forward, but as soon as her hand touches the mechanism, a surge of black energy bursts out from behind.","dialogue_main_10307_1_10":"Watch out! Stay vigilant!","dialogue_main_10307_2_1":"These strange mechanisms and monsters... they're endless.","dialogue_main_10307_2_2":"Damn, it has to be the Abyss!","dialogue_main_10307_2_3":"Anyway, let's go in first.","dialogue_main_10311_1_1":"Lady Elune, we're here to rescue you!","dialogue_main_10311_1_2":"...","dialogue_main_10311_1_3":"In the dark cage, Elune's wings tightly wrap around her body. She still keeps her head buried and makes no response.","dialogue_main_10311_1_4":"The compassionate Merida can't wait and takes a step forward, trying to reach out.","dialogue_main_10311_1_5":"But as a black light flashes, something unexpected happens.","dialogue_main_10311_1_6":"Be careful, this is not Elune!","dialogue_main_10311_1_7":"It's all an <color=#ffa352>illusion of the Abyss</color>...","dialogue_main_10311_1_8":"The shadow of \"Elune\" fades away, revealing a cluster of sinister vines before everyone.","dialogue_main_10311_1_9":"The vines, like claws, weave through Merida's long hair, rapidly entwining her chest and horns, tightly constricting her.","dialogue_main_10311_2_1":"Damn Abyss, always full of trickery and deception!","dialogue_main_10311_2_2":"Merida, are you okay?","dialogue_main_10311_2_3":"Cough... don't worry, they can't harm me!","dialogue_main_10311_2_4":"But if this is an illusion, where is the real Lady Elune?","dialogue_main_10311_2_5":"She's over there.","dialogue_main_10311_2_6":"That's the real cage.","dialogue_main_10311_2_7":"As the Omniguardian points, everyone looks towards the not-so-distant area. The dark mist gradually disperses, revealing a corner of a massive iron cage.","dialogue_main_10315_1_6":"Still, it's the embodiment of a monster.","dialogue_main_10315_1_7":"Defeat it, and we can rescue the Valor Valkyrie.","dialogue_main_10315_1_8":"Let's do it.","dialogue_main_10315_2_10":"This place is not suitable for a prolonged stay. Let's leave for now.","dialogue_main_10315_2_11":"Given the current situation, it seems we can only depart from the <color=#ffa352>Thornwoods</color>.","dialogue_main_10315_2_12":"Fear not, Omniguardian; I got your back.","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_1":"Compassion, generosity, tenacity...","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_2":"As long as you uphold the Christmas spirit","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_3":"The Divine Frost will protect you and bestow upon you blessings of the divine","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_4":"This is the Christmas that we all know and love, Hey, are you even listening, Omniguardian?","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_5":"Oh? Apologies, Catrina. I was distracted by a surge of sacred power.","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_6":"As expected of the Omniguardian! You can feel the power of the Sacred Artifacts without touching them!","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_7":"Sacred Artifacts?","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_8":"The cloak, the goblet, and the sword you see now are the Sacred Artifacts left by the \"Divine Frost\".","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_9":"Because of Lady Fenny's sacrifice, her beloved items became Sacred Artifacts.","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_10":"Divine Frost?","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_11":"What's that?","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_12":"I knew you weren't listening. This was personally conferred by the Omniguardian a thousand years ago.","dialogue_christmas_10000_1_13":"Camon, why don't you tell it in detail? After all, you're more interesting than I am.","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_1":"Despite the desolation of the snowy town, the display room remains warm.","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_2":"Why did the 'Divine Frost' sacrifice herself?","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_3":"Alright, I guess I'm up. Jeez, talk about patience, eh?","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_4":"A thousand years ago, the Frost Beast emerged, and humanity suffered defeat after defeat. At that time, a courageous woman stepped forward. With the three Sacred Artifacts, she faced the Frost Beast alone...","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_5":"In the end, she exchanged her life to seal the Beast and was bestowed the title of 'Divine Frost' by the Omniguardian of the time!","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_6":"The Sacred Artifacts of Lady Fenny were gifts from close friends, so to honor her sacrifice, the tradition of giving gifts has been kept and practiced until now!","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_7":"...","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_8":"Take a breather.","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_9":"Speaking of gifts, in the past, the gifts were always related to the Sacred Artifacts. But those are just boring. Let's try something new this year.","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_10":"What?","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_11":"Something new?","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_12":"What's with that face, Omniguardian?","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_13":"Your gift is already prepared, and it's guaranteed to be a pleasant surprise.","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_14":"Omniguardian, make sure to arrive early. The boss has specially prepared the Christmas Feast and a set of...! That was close, I nearly spoiled the surprise!","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_15":"It's a promise then.","dialogue_christmas_10101_1_16":"Oh? I'm looking forward to it.","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_1":"In the middle of the night, a strange magical fluctuation spreads from the Snow Valley to the town like a ripple, resonating in everyone's dreams.","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_2":"I should just go back to sleep... I promised to meet Catrina tomorrow, after all.","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_3":"The morning comes, and the Omniguardian goes to meet Catrina as promised. But Catrina is puzzled by the Omniguardian's intentions.","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_4":"Christmas... What is that? Ever heard of it, Camon?","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_5":"Nada. Sounds like a festival that only the nobles of Mirlond would celebrate. Nothing we sea folks have to worry about.","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_6":"You look so beautiful. Is that a surprise for me?","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_7":"What's the story behind the outfit you're wearing now?","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_8":"This outfit? I have no idea how it ended up in my wardrobe. Pretty nice, though, don't you think?","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_9":"Did you completely forget about the plans we made yesterday?","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_10":"Plans? I remember inviting you for dinner. Hmm... I do feel like I forgot something. Was it the formal wear? The gift? Or...","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_11":"Come with me. I'll show you something that might jog your memory.","dialogue_christmas_10105_1_12":"Alright, I hope it's something interesting.","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_01":"The Omniguardian leads Catrina to the display room where the three Sacred Artifacts were stored, only to find that the Artifacts had turned into three small stones.","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_02":"So... stones. Is that what you wanted me to see?","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_03":"Why would you put stones in a display room? (whispering) Boss, aren't all the things here supposed to be valuable?","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_04":"Omniguardian, perhaps you owe us an explanation. What is going on with you today?","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_05":"I'm just as confused.","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_06":"I want to know what is going on as well.","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_07":"Hey, Boss, did you notice how on our way here, every house is well-decorated and stuff?","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_08":"I don't think I've ever seen that style of decoration before. By chance, and I do mean by chance... Could there actually be a festival we don't know about?","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_09":"I did. Something might have happened that affected the Omniguardian, or... affected us.","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_10":"So, what do we do now?","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_11":"We investigate, of course!","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_12":"Omniguardian...","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_13":"Before they could leave, Ellie, dressed in festive attire, quietly appears.","dialogue_christmas_10105_2_14":"I'm requesting you... to come with me... to the Snow Valley.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_1":"Hipuas... my friend... He's missing.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_2":"Hipuas? You know Hipuas?","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_3":"Hipuas? Now, why does that name sound familiar? Let me think...","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_4":"No need. Remember the disaster two years ago, where magic lost control and almost destroyed half the town?","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_5":"Why of course! That was such a serious accident... Wait, was he the one who lost control?!","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_6":"Indeed, it was that kid. But from what I hear, after what happened, he hasn't been doing well.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_7":"But none of that matters right now. We need to find him first. Ellie, do you know where he was last seen?","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_8":"Mister Rabbit said, in the Snow Valley. I want to find him...","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_9":"Hipuas, like me... No friends, no festival gifts... I want to give him, a surprise.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_10":"Festival? Do you remember the festival?","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_11":"Ellie seems to be startled by Catrina's sudden increase in volume, clutching her rabbit and shivering a bit.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_12":"You're scaring her, Catrina.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_13":"No need to be nervous, Ellie.","dialogue_christmas_10110_1_14":"Sorry, I was too anxious. Take your time.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_1":"The festival you just mentioned, it wouldn't happen to be that 'Christmas' the Omniguardian just talked about, would it?","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_2":"I... don't know, can't remember...","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_3":"So you're on the same ship, eh?","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_4":"It seems that something is indeed wrong. Keep talking about that kid.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_5":"Snow Valley... I am scared.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_6":"Afraid to go in?","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_7":"Powerful magic... is awakening.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_8":"That power, is extraordinary... I am scared...","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_9":"Powerful magic... Could the kid's magic be running wild again?","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_10":"I don't think so.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_11":"It might be related to everyone's memory loss.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_12":"Omniguardian, please...","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_13":"Regardless, looks like we're making a trip to Snow Valley.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_14":"There's no time to waste. Let's move out now.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_15":"Wait, let's bring along the three Sacred Artifacts.","dialogue_christmas_10110_2_16":"The three stones? Let's bring them... they might come in handy later.","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_1":"The Omniguardian and the group arrive at the entrance of Snow Valley. The biting wind that blew against ordinary humans felt like a sharpened blade, chilling to the bone.","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_2":"*Shivers* It's so cold. Why is the wind so... so strong!","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_3":"Are... are you alright?","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_4":"I... I... I'm okay... f-for now!","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_5":"Don't push yourself. If you go in like this, it will be a sure death.","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_6":"I-I'm heading back then! B-Be careful, Boss!","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_7":"Camon flees from Snow Valley at the fastest speed he has ever run. Meanwhile, a wave of intense magic reverberates from the depths, startling the trio.","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_8":"Is this the magic you were talking about? I've never experienced such cold magic","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_9":"We're... too late... The master of this magic... has awakened...","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_10":"Look! The magic just now awoke those ice crystals and snowmen!","dialogue_christmas_10113_1_11":"We're running out of time, we need to get through quickly!","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_1":"The number of monsters in Snow Valley increases, but it is not enough to stop the trio. As they near the depths of the valley, they see the dazzling light of the sealing array.","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_2":"Roar!!","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_3":"A monster! It's a monster!","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_4":"Help!!","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_5":"Hipuas...!","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_6":"The light gradually dims, and the three see the Frost Beast breaking through the seal, roaring and charging toward the terrified crying boy in the middle of a spell.","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_7":"Don't... don't come any closer!!","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_8":"So this is all your doing, Frost Beast.","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_9":"The Arctic Phoenix descends from the sky. Eudora stands between the boy and the Beast, and blocks the latter's attack with a single hand.","dialogue_christmas_10114_1_10":"Get back to where you belong!","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_1":"The battle between the Frost Beast and Udora continues. Hipuas sits behind Udora, his awe surpassing his urge to cry.","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_2":"The parcel containing the Sacred Artifacts suddenly expands, and the cloak, which has returned to its original state, bursts from the parcel along with the other two stones, falling to the ground.","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_3":"What's this cloak doing here?","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_4":"This is a Sacred Artifact.","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_5":"This cloak is a Sacred Artifact?! So we can use it now?","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_6":"I'm afraid not.","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_7":"Tsk. Forget it, let's help her first!","dialogue_christmas_10115_1_8":"Mister Rabbit, we... we'll join too.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_1":"Only having broken its seal recently, the Beast's Magic has yet to recover. Facing a one-against-three, it reluctantly escapes the scene.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_2":"Udora sheathed her twin swords, turned around, and stared at Hipuas with piercing eyes as if she could see right through him.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_3":"There's a remnant of the power of the Divine Frost on you. Tell me, what did you do?","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_4":"I... I...","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_5":"If you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to. The Omniguardian is here, no one can force you.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_6":"What I do want to know is what is with that Beast, and whether it'll be a threat to humans again.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_7":"That's the Frost Beast. The monster that Fenny sacrificed her life to seal.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_8":"Frost Beast...? Fenny...?","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_9":"Do you remember the Divine Frost?","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_10":"Of course. Fenny once studied combat skills from me. She is one of the few humans I trust.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_11":"It's strange, why are you and the Omniguardian the only ones who remember these... Is there any connection between Christmas and the Divine Frost?","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_12":"I will not forget the sacrifice of the Divine Frost, but I have no interest in your festival.","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_13":"So Christmas... is really gone?","dialogue_christmas_10115_2_14":"What did you say?!","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_1":"What have you done?!","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_2":"I... I...","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_3":"Hipuas, don't be afraid... Can you tell us?","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_4":"There was a voice... It lingered in my ear, leading me here.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_5":"The Frost Beast. What did it say to you?","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_6":"It said, as long as I set it free, it could delete Christmas from existence...","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_7":"Make Christmas... disappear...","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_8":"Could that mean making us all forget about Christmas?","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_9":"Not quite. It should be making people who love Christmas, you forget about Divine Frost.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_10":"Just forgetting lifts the seal on the Frost Beast?","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_11":"I see. The power of Fenny to seal the Frost Beast came from her spirit as the Sacred Frost.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_12":"Kindness, generosity, and tenacity. These were the things that gave her the power to rival the monster.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_13":"In other words... forgetting the 'Divine Frost' is forgetting the Divine Frost spirit, and naturally, the power to seal the Frost Beast would also cease to exist.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_14":"Correct.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_15":"Makes sense, but I still don't understand what we need to do.","dialogue_christmas_10201_1_16":"But there's no time for that now. The monsters are back at it again. Let's deal with them first.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_1":"Phew, that should be all... for now. They seem to have another purpose.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_2":"Kid, why would you want Christmas to cease to exist?","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_3":"Those guys... They always use the past to bully me...","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_4":"They pelt me with snowballs filled with stones, saying that's all I deserve as a gift for the Festival! They know nothing about the Christmas spirit!","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_5":"Their actions are a contradiction to the Christmas spirit.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_6":"Nothing irks me more than bullies. Tell me who they are, and I'll teach them a lesson when I get back.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_7":"Hipuas... I will... avenge you.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_8":"I believe he doesn't need your help. His magic is already strong enough.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_9":"Yes... Thank you, Ellie... But now... I... I just want Christmas to come back.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_10":"Because... I want... your gift.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_11":"The cold and fright made it increasingly difficult for Hipuas to speak. Despite his astonishing magical talents, he was still just a human teenager.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_12":"Ellie takes out a carefully wrapped Flame Stone and places it in Hipuas' freezing hand, bringing him warmth that has been absent for a long time.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_13":"This is your... gift... Merry Christmas, Hipuas.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_14":"Ellie... thank you.","dialogue_christmas_10201_2_15":"Clank! The goblet symbolizing generosity also returns to its original state like the cape, shining brightly on the snow.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_1":"Now a goblet? Is this a Sacred Artifact too?","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_2":"This was left by Fenny, her will endowed them with sacredness.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_3":"Wait... why is there a resonance of other powers on the cloak and the goblet? But this power doesn't belong to the Omniguardian...","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_4":"Could this be your power, Hipuas?","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_5":"Me...?","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_6":"It appears when you cast the spell to release the Frost Beast, you resonated with the Sacred Artifacts.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_7":"What does that mean?","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_8":"He will have to be the one to break the seals on the Sacred Artifacts.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_9":"But how? It didn't seem like he actually did anything earlier, the two Sacred Artifacts just popped out from the stones.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_10":"Before Catrina could get an answer, a ground-shaking roar comes from the direction of the town.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_11":"Damn it! It's headed into town! We have to go back immediately!","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_12":"The Sacred Artifacts... haven't... been restored...","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_13":"Forget about the Sacred Artifacts for now. The town's safety comes first.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_14":"Catrina is right.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_15":"Let's hurry.","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_16":"What... what about me...","dialogue_christmas_10205_1_17":"We... go home... together.","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_1":"Snow Monsters, awakened by the magic of the Frost Beast, are on a rampage in the town. Their only target: the Sacred Artifacts.","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_2":"Sensing that two of the Sacred Artifacts have been unsealed, the Frost Beast grows angrier and roars at the sky in the town.","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_3":"Help! Save me!","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_4":"Over here! I will protect you!","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_5":"Boss! You're back!","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_6":"Good job, Camon. Leave the rest to us. You lead the townsfolk out of the town.","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_7":"Understood!","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_8":"The Frost Beast roars angrily, having smelled the awakened Sacred Artifacts and also discovered Hipuas' tracks.","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_9":"The Snow Monsters gather around Hipuas and his group, but Ellie steps forward with the rabbit in her embrace.","dialogue_christmas_10210_1_10":"Stay behind me, Hipuas. I will protect you.","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_1":"Eudora notices that the Snow Monsters summoned by the Frost Beast are not adamant about fighting.","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_2":"It's targeting Hipuas and the Sacred Artifacts! It must have sensed the connection between the boy and the Sacred Artifacts! It fears being sealed again.","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_3":"Afraid...? Can such a powerful monster also feel fear?","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_4":"Of course! Even the most powerful creatures have weaknesses. As long as you grasp their weaknesses, even half-baked ones like you can defeat it!","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_5":"Hipuas, you released... the Frost Beast. You can also... seal it.","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_6":"But... but...","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_7":"What are you but-ing about, kid?","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_8":"Legend has it that the Divine Frost sacrificed itself after sealing the monster... W-Will I also die?","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_9":"You will be fine.","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_10":"You are not alone.","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_11":"That's right! Fenny was alone back then, but now you have us fighting alongside you!","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_12":"My spear will protect you from harm, so go ahead and do it, kid!","dialogue_christmas_10210_2_13":"I...","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_1":"Hipuas takes the last sealed Sacred Artifact handed by the Omniguardian. Mustering his courage, he steps out from behind Ellie.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_2":"I don't really hate Christmas, and I don't want everyone to be eaten. I just... want to be loved by everyone, I want companions.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_3":"As Hipuas moves forward, the stone in his hand emits a faint light, its shell shattered, and a sword symbolizing tenacity appears in his hand.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_4":"I don't want Christmas to disappear... You ferocious Beast...","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_5":"...Give us back our Christmas!","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_6":"Hipuas chants an ancient spell, and the three Sacred Artifacts release a holy light. At the moment the chant ended, they flew toward the three women respectively.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_7":"This is...","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_8":"I feel... powerful.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_9":"Pick it up, and use it to fight.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_10":"The three of them each hold the Sacred Artifact in front of them, and feel the surging energy circulating in their bodies.","dialogue_christmas_10215_1_11":"At this moment, the benevolent Divine, the generous girl, and the tenacious warrior, all resonate with the Sacred Artifacts.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_1":"After the fierce battle, the Frost Beast falls to the ground with a thud. In an instant, the three Sacred Artifacts' radiance fades and turns into dust, and Hipuas falls to the ground, exhausted.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_2":"Are you alright, Hipuas?","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_3":"I'm fine...","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_4":"It seems the mission of the Sacred Artifacts has ended.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_5":"I suppose you can rest now, Fenny.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_6":"So... do we still need Christmas?","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_7":"Of course, who wouldn't like Christmas, also... wait?! I remember now!","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_8":"Me too...","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_9":"Looks like Christmas has 'returned'.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_10":"The bells of midnight ring at this moment, the lost and regained Christmas has finally arrived.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_11":"Ladies and Gentlemen, Merry Christmas!","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_12":"Since Christmas is here, and we just won a great battle, why not celebrate all night until dawn?","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_13":"Good idea.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_14":"If you say so, Omniguardian! It's decided then!","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_15":"Hipuas, we... together.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_16":"Yeah!","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_17":"You can count me out.","dialogue_christmas_10215_2_18":"Oh no you don't!","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_1":"Let's raise a glass together! Today, we drink!","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_2":"Hey Catrina, where's my gift?","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_3":"Ha! Curious about your gift, Omniguardian?","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_4":"Finish this drink, then I'll consider whether to tell you or not.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_5":"Ah... it's so noisy... But since I'm already here... I suppose doing this once a year wouldn't hurt.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_6":"Hipuas, you can... have this... as well...","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_7":"You've already given me a gift, Ellie, I haven't even prepared your gift...","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_8":"It's ok... Make it up... to me... next year...","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_9":"...Thank you, Ellie. I think I now understand how the seal of the Sacred Artifacts was lifted.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_10":"How...?","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_11":"The Divine protected me, letting me know that I'm not a pitiful creature abandoned by the world.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_12":"Catrina is very brave, she showed me how to be strong.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_13":"And thank you so much for your generous friendship, it's very warm.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_14":"I guess that's what the Christmas spirit actually means–at least that's how I interpret it... I don't know if you think the same, but still, thank you all so much!","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_15":"Alright, alright, that's enough thank-you's. Raise your glasses! You two can have juice.","dialogue_christmas_10216_1_16":"Now... let the fun begin!","dialogue_season1_10101_1_1":"A mysterious invitation, accompanied by a guiding black cat, leads the Omniguardian to the Eternal Gate.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_2":"Omniguardian, you've arrived.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_3":"Bastet, did you discover anything?","dialogue_season1_10101_1_4":"I've heard the call of the <color=#ffa352>Eternal Relic</color>.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_5":"By crossing the Eternal Gate, we can reach the land where the Relic was lost.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_6":"With the Relic's return, our strength against the Abyss will significantly increase.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_7":"However, for me...","dialogue_season1_10101_1_8":"Bastet lazily rises, lightly beckoning with her finger.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_9":"I just want to nap by your side a little longer.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_10":"To fulfill my wish, let's set out, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_11":"The last time we traveled to Itheron together was a thousand years ago.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_12":"I don't remember.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_13":"What happened then?","dialogue_season1_10101_1_14":"It was... quite a delicious night.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_15":"But it seems that time can't heal everything.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_16":"At least for this place, the impact of that calamity has not yet faded.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_17":"\"Calamity?\"","dialogue_season1_10101_1_18":"I might have said too much.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_19":"Omniguardian, I sense the Relic not far ahead.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_20":"The ground trembles! The source of the anomaly comes from the thick fog shrouding the stream.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_21":"Shh... Omniguardian, a big fellow is about to appear.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_22":"Such incredible power.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_23":"Is he a Divine from the Seraphic Court? There are people on that boat as well.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_24":"But why is he risking everything to take the boat away?","dialogue_season1_10101_1_25":"There's something in the fog he wants to avoid.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_26":"You're right. There's a terrible smell in the fog.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_27":"The ground trembles again, and grotesque monsters emerge, rushing towards the sluggish Divine.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_28":"Omniguardian, those enemies exude a <color=#ffa352>corrupted</color> aura.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_29":"They're no longer human.","dialogue_season1_10101_1_30":"Defeat them.","dialogue_season1_10105_1_1":"The stony Divine suddenly halts. Before him lies the end of the stream, a cliff abruptly cutting off the path.","dialogue_season1_10105_1_2":"...","dialogue_season1_10105_1_3":"Nowhere to go? Come back and help us.","dialogue_season1_10105_1_4":"Protect... the survivors...","dialogue_season1_10105_1_5":"The man suddenly tightens every muscle in his body. With a muffled groan, he manages to support the large boat with both palms.","dialogue_season1_10105_1_6":"Is he trying to jump off the cliff while holding the boat? Is he suicidal?","dialogue_season1_10105_1_7":"Stop him!","dialogue_season1_10105_1_8":"Omniguardian, watch out for the enemies behind you!","dialogue_season1_10105_2_1":"It's too late.","dialogue_season1_10105_2_2":"Wind, please respond to my call!","dialogue_season1_10105_2_3":"Suddenly, a girl appears, seemingly able to manipulate the wind, pushing the Divine back from the cliff's edge.","dialogue_season1_10105_2_4":"You...","dialogue_season1_10105_2_5":"Argh! cough, cough...","dialogue_season1_10105_2_6":"Are you okay? Did you overuse your power?","dialogue_season1_10105_2_7":"Behind the softly coughing girl, a strange <color=#ffa352>glint of scales</color> flashes.","dialogue_season1_10105_2_8":"Are you okay?","dialogue_season1_10105_2_9":"What's with that light...?","dialogue_season1_10105_2_10":"Don't worry about me. First, let's deal with the tricky enemies!","dialogue_season1_10105_2_11":"So troublesome. Can't you let me rest for a bit?","dialogue_season1_10105_2_12":"Omniguardian, how would you like me to proceed?","dialogue_season1_10105_2_13":"Fight for me.","dialogue_season1_10105_2_14":"Since you say so, I'll have to pull myself together.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_1":"When fighting alongside you, my power becomes stronger!","dialogue_season1_10110_1_2":"Who exactly are you?","dialogue_season1_10110_1_3":"I am...","dialogue_season1_10110_1_4":"Don't suddenly fast-forward to the part where you exchange names!","dialogue_season1_10110_1_5":"I'm only telling her my name...","dialogue_season1_10110_1_6":"But... but I want to possess everything about you.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_7":"I have seen you, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_8":"The stony Divine finishes off the last enemy, approaching with steady steps.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_9":"I am Elmer, the Divine guarding the camp.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_10":"Grateful for your assistance and that of the Valkyrie.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_11":"So you're an <color=#ffa352>Omniguardian</color>!","dialogue_season1_10110_1_12":"No wonder your power feels familiar...","dialogue_season1_10110_1_13":"I haven't had the chance to introduce myself yet; I am Gloria.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_14":"Noticing the disturbance in this camp, I came to lend my support.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_15":"Camp? Disturbance?","dialogue_season1_10110_1_16":"Elmer doesn't answer, merely silently taking out a crystal emitting a divine glow.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_17":"You took the <color=#ffa352>Divine Crystals</color> from the altar in the camp?","dialogue_season1_10110_1_18":"The Divine Crystals?","dialogue_season1_10110_1_19":"These are purified Divine Crystals from the <color=#ffa352>Supreme Relic</color>. I only took some of them.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_20":"Do you know where the Relic is?","dialogue_season1_10110_1_21":"The Relic is in the temple, guarded by the priests.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_22":"Finally, we have some information about the Relic... Oh no, more monsters have been attracted by the crystal!","dialogue_season1_10110_1_23":"Deal with them.","dialogue_season1_10110_1_24":"May they find rest in redemption.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_1":"Finally, a chance to take a break. What kind of trouble have you stirred up?","dialogue_season1_10110_2_2":"The Abyss is encroaching on this area.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_3":"Fortunately, the <color=#ffa352>Temple</color> provides shelter, so this place has not completely fallen yet.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_4":"The <color=#ffa352>Divine Protection</color> of that temple is quite formidable.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_5":"Yes, with the help of the Divine, the priests use the Divine Crystals to form a spell that wards off the invasion of monsters.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_6":"The camp we're stationed at is a part of that spell.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_7":"Then how did those Abyss monsters get in?","dialogue_season1_10110_2_8":"Because the spell... is deactivated. Please allow me to bid you farewell, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_9":"Even if the chances are slim, I must try and reclaim the camp and ensure the safety of the temple.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_10":"To retrieve the Relic, we must pass through the camp.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_11":"Since we're on the same path, even if I wanted to laze around, there's no reason to let those Abyss monsters run amok.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_12":"There might be survivors in the camp.","dialogue_season1_10110_2_13":"I knew it; even if there's only the slightest glimmer of hope, you won't give up.","dialogue_season1_10115_1_1":"The camp is in disarray, with buildings destroyed by Abyss monsters scattered everywhere.","dialogue_season1_10115_1_2":"Where's the activation point for the spell?","dialogue_season1_10115_1_3":"The <color=#ffa352>altar</color> ahead.","dialogue_season1_10115_1_4":"You lead the way.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_1":"After clearing the enemies blocking their path, the four finally arrive near the altar.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_2":"Hmm? That slate on the altar... Why does it seem familiar?","dialogue_season1_10115_2_3":"Could this be the lost <color=#ffa352>Slate</color>?","dialogue_season1_10115_2_4":"The Slate?","dialogue_season1_10115_2_5":"The last time I saw one of these slates was a thousand years ago.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_6":"People forged Slates to seek the blessing of the Valkyric Power, offering them to our Relic.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_7":"If we can use <color=#ffa352>Stones</color> to activate the <color=#ffa352>Slate's</color> energy, we can gain powerful assistance.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_8":"The Divine once mentioned that the Divine Crystals can replace slate stones to activate the Slate.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_9":"That's a pleasant surprise. Leave the pursuers to us, then. You quickly use the Divine Crystals to activate the Slate!","dialogue_season1_10115_2_10":"I'm faster. Let me help.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_11":"Gloria takes the Divine Crystals. She runs as fast as the wind, but hesitates before the Slate.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_12":"Gloria, activate the Slate!","dialogue_season1_10115_2_13":"...I'm sorry, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_14":"Gloria's gaze becomes determined, and she reaches out for the remaining Divine Crystals.","dialogue_season1_10115_2_15":"<color=#ffa352>I can't leave the Divine Crystals here.</color>","dialogue_season1_10201_1_1":"In the name of the Spring of Eternal Youth, I will take back your life <color=#ffa352>Demon</color>.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_2":"Althea? Why are you here?","dialogue_season1_10201_1_3":"The Abyss threat is imminent, and the temple can't lose your protection!","dialogue_season1_10201_1_4":"I will not allow this Demon to destroy the Slate.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_5":"Uh, I...!","dialogue_season1_10201_1_6":"Silence.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_7":"The rope tightens, and Gloria struggles, no longer able to conceal the butterfly wings behind her.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_8":"Wings? She's not human?","dialogue_season1_10201_1_9":"You shouldn't have been deceived by her disguise.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_10":"Without waiting for Elmer's answer, Althea's rope cuts through Gloria's skin, green blood splattering.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_11":"?!","dialogue_season1_10201_1_12":"Her blood is corroding your stone skin!","dialogue_season1_10201_1_13":"Indeed, it is the blood of a Demon...","dialogue_season1_10201_1_14":"This despicable Demon infiltrated many camps with her harmless appearance.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_15":"The fall of this camp is probably related to her.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_16":"I just didn't expect even the Omniguardian would be deceived by her.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_17":"Do you know me?","dialogue_season1_10201_1_18":"A hint of surprise flashes in Althea's eyes. Gloria seizes this brief distraction, breaking free from the constraints.","dialogue_season1_10201_1_19":"Don't let her take the Divine Crystals!","dialogue_season1_10201_1_20":"A cat chasing butterfly game? I like it.","dialogue_season1_10205_1_1":"She flies fast! Too bad the sky is no longer within a cat's reach.","dialogue_season1_10205_1_2":"I am deeply sorry. This matter arose from my misplaced trust in her...","dialogue_season1_10205_1_3":"Now is not the time for self-blame.","dialogue_season1_10205_1_4":"First, let's eliminate the Abyss invaders and put an end to the chaos in the camp.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_1":"Then we can reactivate the spell.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_2":"After tidying up the aftermath, Althea extracts the Divine Crystals from within herself and reactivates the Slate.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_3":"Once the new crystal fills the empty slot, the Slate emits a radiant divine light.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_4":"Ugh... Ahh...","dialogue_season1_10205_2_5":"The power of the crystal... why does it cause such pain in my heart?","dialogue_season1_10205_2_6":"Re-establishing the connection made you understand the threats the temple faces.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_7":"Only by quelling the threat will the pain subside.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_8":"...","dialogue_season1_10205_2_9":"I didn't know a Divine could also produce crystals.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_10":"The crystals we produce are not pure enough, but there's currently no better solution.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_11":"The temple is in such danger, yet you chose to come and help us.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_12":"Bastet's tone is easygoing, yet it conceals a probing undertone. The smart cat is now wary.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_13":"If only you were in danger, I wouldn't have abandoned my duty to guard the temple.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_14":"I came specifically because I sensed the arrival of the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_15":"Because of me?","dialogue_season1_10205_2_16":"Perhaps you've forgotten me, but... you're the <color=#ffa352>only and most important</color> existence in my long life.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_17":"A thousand years ago, it was you who personally dispatched me to guard the temple.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_18":"I've always believed that you would come to save us.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_19":"So, I implore you, to help us repel the Abyss monsters besieging the temple!","dialogue_season1_10205_2_20":"Only by eliminating the Abyss threat can we retrieve the Relic.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_21":"Retrieve the Relic.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_22":"Clear the Abyss threat.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_23":"Although troublesome, I believe that with your help, we can overcome any obstacle in our path.","dialogue_season1_10205_2_24":"With your help, there's nothing we can't overcome.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_1":"There's no sign of enemies nearby.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_2":"Omniguardian, I'll stand watch for you.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_3":"Come over here, Omniguardian. Don't waste this pleasant evening.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_4":"You wouldn't refuse my invitation, would you?","dialogue_season1_10210_1_5":"Lady Valkyrie, please join me in shouldering the duty of guarding.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_6":"You should both come over and rest.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_7":"I should take the night watch.","dialogue_season1_10210_1_8":"No! Omniguardian is mine and mine alone!","dialogue_season1_10210_1_9":"Please don't spoil us too much, and besides...","dialogue_season1_10210_1_10":"A demonic roar echoes from the nearby bushes!","dialogue_season1_10210_1_11":"We missed some.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_1":"The monster's ambush dirties the golden feathers on Althea's shoulders.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_2":"Allow me to clean them up a bit.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_3":"The cleansing of the clear spring restores the dusty feathers to their radiant glory.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_4":"Is there perhaps the power of the Omniguardian engraved on these golden feathers?","dialogue_season1_10210_2_5":"Omniguardian, do you not remember?","dialogue_season1_10210_2_6":"Althea takes off a golden feather and hands it to the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_7":"These feathers bear the inscription of our <color=#ffa352>Eternal Oath</color>.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_8":"...","dialogue_season1_10210_2_9":"I'm sorry.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_10":"I don't mean to blame you. It's just that...","dialogue_season1_10210_2_11":"Every moment without you feels particularly long.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_12":"The Omniguardian has lost his memory, but his goal has never changed.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_13":"Althea, however, remains indifferent. She gazes at the golden feather until it turns into a wisp of black mist and dissipates.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_14":"The past has already vanished with the wind. Omniguardian, sweet dreams.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_15":"Bastet tidies up the camp, making it warm and dry. The Omniguardian lies in her lap, and the view above is filled with starlight.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_16":"The cat lady's eyes shine as bright and deep as the galaxy.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_17":"Omniguardian... I can feel that she has never truly let go of the past.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_18":"...","dialogue_season1_10210_2_19":"Why are people so attached to the past?","dialogue_season1_10210_2_20":"...Perhaps Arkdina was right. As someone with only divinity now, you might not fully understand this feeling.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_21":"It's very late, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10210_2_22":"At least for tonight, let us embrace each other.","dialogue_season1_10211_1_1":"Dawn is breaking. Let's continue our journey.","dialogue_season1_10211_1_2":"Mmm... Ah! I haven't had enough sleep...","dialogue_season1_10211_1_3":"Omniguardian, last night was truly sweet and satisfying.","dialogue_season1_10211_1_4":"The temple is not far ahead. Please pay attention to what you say!","dialogue_season1_10211_1_5":"Oh? Could it be that someone who bailed at the last minute is now feeling jealous?","dialogue_season1_10211_1_6":"I...!","dialogue_season1_10211_1_7":"Traces of monsters found ahead!","dialogue_season1_10211_1_8":"Good, let's take out our morning frustrations on them.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_1":"After a challenging battle, the group finally breaks through the monster encirclement and reaches the exterior of the temple.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_2":"There are quite a few monsters inside here too. Are they not giving us any breathing room?","dialogue_season1_10215_1_3":"This aura... Has the Abyss already corrupted the temple?!","dialogue_season1_10215_1_4":"They... those monsters were once <color=#ffa352>priests who served the temple</color>.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_5":"I'm afraid the temple has fallen...","dialogue_season1_10215_1_6":"Ensure the safety of the Relic first.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_7":"I sense the call of the Relic! It's the <color=#ffa352>Python's Mirror</color>.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_8":"It's right ahead!","dialogue_season1_10215_1_9":"Guided by Bastet, the group locates the whereabouts of the Relic.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_10":"Found it! Wait, is that...","dialogue_season1_10215_1_11":"...My sins, my faults...","dialogue_season1_10215_1_12":"It's an enemy.","dialogue_season1_10215_1_13":"High Priest, have you too been corrupted by the Abyss?","dialogue_season1_10215_1_14":"...Please cleanse the injustices that have accompanied me...","dialogue_season1_10215_1_15":"Omniguardian, please bring an end to his misfortune.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_1":"Groan... Ah...","dialogue_season1_10215_2_2":"Why struggle in his dying moments? Death would've been a relief for him.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_3":"...","dialogue_season1_10215_2_4":"Dying peacefully would be a good thing for him.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_5":"However... High Priest, I believe you have something to say to the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_6":"Althea reveals a cold smile, madness pouring unfiltered from her eyes.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_7":"Aaaahhh!","dialogue_season1_10215_2_8":"How pitiful, killed by the Omniguardian you believed in.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_9":"But it's okay. With me here, you won't truly die.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_10":"...Lady Althea?","dialogue_season1_10215_2_11":"I don't want to pretend anymore.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_12":"High Priest, tell Omniguardian the <color=#ffa352>truth</color>.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_13":"Omniguardian... You must be careful...","dialogue_season1_10215_2_14":"Be cautious, this woman...!!","dialogue_season1_10215_2_15":"Hehe... hehehe... hahahaha!!","dialogue_season1_10215_2_16":"You still haven't learned your lesson.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_17":"The Omniguardian has forgotten us. He abandoned the faith we had in him long ago.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_18":"But that's okay... there's still one last chance.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_19":"I won't remain silent. I'll reclaim everything that belongs to me.","dialogue_season1_10215_2_20":"Stay by my side, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season1_10301_1_1":"Althea strokes the Eternal Relic the Python's Mirror, and the mirror responds to her request.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_2":"The Relic refuses to serve me. It has already been corrupted by the Abyss!","dialogue_season1_10301_1_3":"This is bad. Althea is being controlled by the corrupted Relic.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_4":"Althea, stay away from the Relic!","dialogue_season1_10301_1_5":"You're too late, and you're mistaken.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_6":"It's not the Relic controlling me; it's me controlling the Relic.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_7":"No... you've been influenced by the Relic all along?","dialogue_season1_10301_1_8":"This temple fell to the monsters months ago.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_9":"What a beautiful night it was, witnessing the tragic deaths of those priests who once <color=#ffa352>imprisoned</color> me!","dialogue_season1_10301_1_10":"Instead of being confined in a cage, humiliated as their tool to <color=#ffa352>extract the Divine Crystals</color>.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_11":"...The crystals in the camp weren't extracted from the Relic?!","dialogue_season1_10301_1_12":"The Relic refused to respond to the priests' greedy demands.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_13":"Foolish mortals, attempting to use the crystals to maintain their rule.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_14":"How absurd. I've protected this place for thousands of years, only to be met with betrayal.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_15":"It's time to end all this.","dialogue_season1_10301_1_16":"Awaken, the army of the fallen!","dialogue_season1_10301_1_17":"<color=#ffa352>Shatter everything you once believed in, and bring the Omniguardian to my side!</color>","dialogue_season1_10301_2_1":"Omniguardian, why resist? Why struggle?","dialogue_season1_10301_2_2":"Accept reality, just as I've stood guard by myself for a thousand years following your order!","dialogue_season1_10301_2_3":"Calm down.","dialogue_season1_10301_2_4":"Don't let the Relic control you!","dialogue_season1_10301_2_5":"When the Eternal Gate was activated again, I sensed you.","dialogue_season1_10301_2_6":"I desperately wanted to seek your help, but...","dialogue_season1_10301_2_7":"<color=#ffa352>You whispered in my ear... \"Don't go.\"</color>","dialogue_season1_10305_1_1":"\"Don't go... Don't go... Don't go!\"","dialogue_season1_10305_1_2":"Your voice was so close to me... echoing in my ears, resonating in my mind...","dialogue_season1_10305_1_3":"I've never called for you.","dialogue_season1_10305_1_4":"The Omniguardian has forgotten even his own identity, but remembers you?","dialogue_season1_10305_1_5":"I can't possibly be mistaken about your voice!","dialogue_season1_10305_1_6":"I awaited your command, hoping you'd personally come to the temple.","dialogue_season1_10305_1_7":"Even if it meant letting my guard down and being imprisoned by the priests... I foolishly hoped for redemption by you.","dialogue_season1_10305_1_8":"All the humiliation I endured was because of you...","dialogue_season1_10305_1_9":"You were once my faith, my god... but you treated me as a pitiful <color=#ffa352>pawn</color>.","dialogue_season1_10305_1_10":"If faith can't bring redemption, then let me tear apart these hypocritical ties!","dialogue_season1_10305_1_11":"The Relic has disturbed her sanity... Now, we have no choice but to fight!","dialogue_season1_10305_2_1":"The three retreated as they fought, facing off against Althea in the advantageous terrain within the temple.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_2":"Don't let your guard down. The enemy could launch an attack at any moment.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_3":"...Look, behind you.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_4":"The Omniguardian turns around, only to see a statue of Althea inside the main hall, bound by iron chains.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_5":"The chains bear the residual energy of an imprisoning spell.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_6":"This is... where Althea was <color=#ffa352>imprisoned</color>.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_7":"Elmer gazes sadly at everything before him. It's only now that he realizes...","dialogue_season1_10305_2_8":"I, along with the safety of the camp, have deepened the suffering of my kin.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_9":"Upon reflection, there are many strange details.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_10":"Omniguardian, you didn't really go looking for her, did you?","dialogue_season1_10305_2_11":"That's impossible...","dialogue_season1_10305_2_12":"That's true. No one knows your whereabouts better than I do.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_13":"That sounds scary...","dialogue_season1_10305_2_14":"Haha... just kidding. I can't really think straight when the atmosphere gets too heavy.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_15":"So, who is this \"Omniguardian\" that Althea mentioned and convinced her to stay?","dialogue_season1_10305_2_16":"And that \"Lord\" who supposedly rescued her... just a coincidence?","dialogue_season1_10305_2_17":"There's a mastermind behind all this.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_18":"A mystery to unravel? I like that.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_19":"Althea's cynical laughter interrupts the conversation.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_20":"Lady Valkyrie, don't play hide and seek. Give me back my Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10305_2_21":"No. He is mine!","dialogue_season1_10310_1_1":"The defeated enemies rise again one after another.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_2":"Give up the struggle.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_3":"With the <color=#ffa352>blessing of the Spring of Eternal Youth</color>, my fallen army can't be killed. Hmm?","dialogue_season1_10310_1_4":"Althea looks to the sky, as if countless eyes were watching her through thick, dark clouds.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_5":"Suddenly, a massive black butterfly parts the clouds and launches an attack on the fallen below!","dialogue_season1_10310_1_6":"<color=#ffa352>Gloria</color>, you've finally come.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_7":"Is that the original Demon form of Gloria?","dialogue_season1_10310_1_8":"She's... helping us.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_9":"Omniguardian!","dialogue_season1_10310_1_10":"The Omniguardian repels the enemies ahead, and the black butterfly falls in front of him, as if its strength is depleted.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_11":"After a painful transformation, the butterfly turns into the Demon girl from yesterday.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_12":"Gloria timidly reaches out to the Omniguardian. She awaits a response, a form of <color=#ffa352>acknowledgment</color>.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_13":"I'll help you up.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_14":"Sorry... for losing control in front of you.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_15":"Thank you for still believing in me, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_16":"The situation unfolds as predicted by <color=#ffa352>the Lord</color>.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_17":"You do care about \"that Lord.\" Because \"the Lord\" saved you?","dialogue_season1_10310_1_18":"You'll find out soon.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_19":"Althea grabs the Relic, and the Python's Mirror releases a mysterious light in her palm.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_20":"Immediately, the ground shifts beneath them, and a maze emerges!","dialogue_season1_10310_1_21":"Omniguardian, grab my hand!","dialogue_season1_10310_1_22":"The maze walls quickly divide the four.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_23":"We're separated? Althea must be planning to take us down one by one.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_24":"There's a disturbance ahead.","dialogue_season1_10310_1_25":"This aura... It's an Abyss monster!","dialogue_season1_10310_1_26":"Omniguardian, it has noticed us!","dialogue_season1_10315_1_1":"Omniguardian, ahead is where the fog is thickest.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_2":"Could you hold my hand again?","dialogue_season1_10315_1_3":"Sure.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_4":"Thank you. You've given me the courage to face the impossible. I don't seem to be as afraid of this fog anymore.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_5":"Let's go!","dialogue_season1_10315_1_6":"Gloria looks resolute as the two figures are quickly engulfed by the dense fog.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_7":"As the fog disperses, a cute and cozy cottage appears before them.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_8":"Is this... someone's home? So adorable!","dialogue_season1_10315_1_9":"Oh, is that a cake?","dialogue_season1_10315_1_10":"Perhaps we can sit down and enjoy some treats together...","dialogue_season1_10315_1_11":"This is an illusion.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_12":"Don't be misled by the illusion.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_13":"But how could it be an illusion? Everything here feels so real.","dialogue_season1_10315_1_14":"Little monster, still thinking about cake?","dialogue_season1_10315_1_15":"Given how many people you've killed, this sweet dream doesn't belong to you!","dialogue_season1_10315_1_16":"No... I...","dialogue_season1_10315_1_17":"Redeem your sins with your life!","dialogue_season1_10315_2_1":"The shadows roar angrily, and the surroundings transition to the familiar setting of the temple.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_2":"The priests are fleeing for their lives, and the source of their terror is none other than Gloria.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_3":"Three... two... one! Is everyone hidden?","dialogue_season1_10315_2_4":"Then I'll turn all of you into <color=#ffa352>minced meat cakes</color>!","dialogue_season1_10315_2_5":"...Gloria?","dialogue_season1_10315_2_6":"You're not Gloria.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_7":"Handsome, why are you looking around like that? Lost, perhaps?","dialogue_season1_10315_2_8":"I quite fancy your pretty appearance, but unfortunately...","dialogue_season1_10315_2_9":"You're foolish enough to help that <color=#ffa352>traitor who betrayed the Abyss</color>.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_10":"The corrupted Gloria laughs loudly.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_11":"No! I don't want to make the same mistakes again!","dialogue_season1_10315_2_12":"Gloria, is she your past?","dialogue_season1_10315_2_13":"Yes. As you can see, the fall of this temple is my doing.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_14":"Handsome, don't listen to her. She just wants to use you to escape.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_15":"Don't forget that Demons are always synonymous with lies.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_16":"The corrupted Gloria approaches, but the Omniguardian forces her back with a determined gaze.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_17":"Tch, how ridiculous. Is this the man you've chosen?","dialogue_season1_10315_2_18":"He won't even bother to refute the accusations against you!","dialogue_season1_10315_2_19":"No, the Omniguardian has forgiven me, accepted me...","dialogue_season1_10315_2_20":"She's just an illusion.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_21":"But... I'm afraid of being swayed by her words and repeating my mistakes.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_22":"She's a specter of my past, a demon living in my heart...","dialogue_season1_10315_2_23":"Let me help you overcome your inner demons.","dialogue_season1_10315_2_24":"Can you really?","dialogue_season1_10401_1_1":"Gloria gazes at the Omniguardian, and after a moment, she finally decides to lay her entire past bare.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_2":"The first half of my life was spent under the dominance of lies.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_3":"I succumbed to the Abyss's temptation and became a vanguard of the Abyss.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_4":"I did... many terrible things.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_5":"Gloria looks at the Omniguardian, her eyes filled with tears of remorse.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_6":"The past pain has been tormenting her, but she deserves a <color=#ffa352>better future</color>.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_7":"You have to overcome your past self.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_8":"What... what should I do?","dialogue_season1_10401_1_9":"First, stand up again.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_10":"I'll follow your lead.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_11":"You must put an end to your past mistakes.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_12":"The Omniguardian hands his sword to Gloria, pointing towards the corrupted version of herself.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_13":"...I seem to understand what you mean.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_14":"What are you trying to do?!","dialogue_season1_10401_1_15":"...I want to bravely confront the mistakes I've made.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_16":"Coward, traitor! Get away from me!","dialogue_season1_10401_1_17":"...This is the first step towards redemption.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_18":"Please, don't... you've already freed yourself, you don't need to...","dialogue_season1_10401_1_19":"<color=#ffa352>Farewell, my nightmare.</color>","dialogue_season1_10401_1_20":"Gloria raises the sword high and delivers a powerful blow, piercing through her reflection.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_21":"Countless rays of light burst from the shattered entity, and the illusions woven by the fog collapse.","dialogue_season1_10401_1_22":"Omniguardian, the illusion is gone. Quickly, let's leave this place!","dialogue_season1_10401_2_1":"The maze is an illusion created by Althea using the Relic, and only those with a steadfast heart can find a way out.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_2":"If it weren't for you, I would truly be trapped in this illusion forever.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_3":"Althea seems to understand your past very well.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_4":"...The destinies of Althea and me intersect in this temple.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_5":"As you can see, I once carried out slaughter in the temple until the divine power in the Relic awakened me.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_6":"I was like a child who found a treasure chest but couldn't find the key.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_7":"A clear mind can lead to confusion.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_8":"Confusion makes me persistent in all of this, which is this temple.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_9":"If we can liberate the temple, perhaps, I can understand what <color=#ffa352>redemption</color> truly means.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_10":"Then why steal the Divine Crystals?","dialogue_season1_10401_2_11":"Those crystals can transform into Althea's power.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_12":"I didn't want her to have additional assistance in the final battle.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_13":"The fog finally disperses, and the exit of the maze appears at the end of their sight.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_14":"Let's give Althea a surprise.","dialogue_season1_10401_2_15":"Understood, as you command!","dialogue_season1_10405_1_1":"Near the exit, the two see their comrades engaged in battle with monsters.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_2":"I knew this hastily constructed maze couldn't trap the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_3":"Step back! The ground is splitting open!","dialogue_season1_10405_1_4":"The earth, cracked from the ongoing battle, is about to swallow the unalert Gloria.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_5":"Ahhh!!","dialogue_season1_10405_1_6":"In the nick of time, Elmer gathers boulders, rescuing Gloria.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_7":"As a Divine, you're not as stubborn as I thought.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_8":"Lady Gloria is not an enemy.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_9":"There are king souls among the Demons.","dialogue_season1_10405_1_10":"Omniguardian, you want to protect that filthy Demon?","dialogue_season1_10405_1_11":"Even though her fate, like mine, changed because of the temple's fall...","dialogue_season1_10405_1_12":"Why do you only care about her?","dialogue_season1_10405_1_13":"Poor Althea, can't you see your own heart?","dialogue_season1_10405_1_14":"Why are you afraid to face your <color=#ffa352>feelings</color> for the Omniguardian?","dialogue_season1_10405_1_15":"No... You've all misled the Omniguardian, made him forget his crucial duties, forget our oath...","dialogue_season1_10405_1_16":"From now on, the Omniguardian can only stay by my side... He can only care about me!","dialogue_season1_10405_1_17":"I won't let you take the Omniguardian away from me again!","dialogue_season1_10405_2_1":"It's not over yet...","dialogue_season1_10405_2_2":"Don't let hatred blind your eyes.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_3":"This path leads only to its end. I have no other refuge.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_4":"You're a Royal I personally appointed.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_5":"There will always be a place for you by my side.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_6":"The Omniguardian awakens the <color=#ffa352>pact</color> with Althea, and golden feathers instantly burst into a dazzling light.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_7":"I won't give up on you.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_8":"Why... Why do you still give me hope?","dialogue_season1_10405_2_9":"Omniguardian, the Relic's control over Althea is weakening! Hurry, purify the Relic!","dialogue_season1_10405_2_10":"Omniguardian, it's not over yet, you...","dialogue_season1_10405_2_11":"Don't worry. I'll protect you.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_12":"No, what I mean is...","dialogue_season1_10405_2_13":"Just as the Omniguardian is about to purify the Relic with the Omnideus, the surrounding space suddenly undergoes unstable fissures!","dialogue_season1_10405_2_14":"The corrupting force surrounding the area intensifies. Someone is coming?","dialogue_season1_10405_2_15":"A mysterious figure, ghost-like, tears through the space and lands beside Althea.","dialogue_season1_10405_2_16":"...Lord...","dialogue_season1_10405_2_17":"Worthless.","dialogue_season1_10406_1_1":"So useless, hehe.","dialogue_season1_10406_1_2":"The mysterious figure laughs contemptuously, using his heel to crush Althea's wings ruthlessly.","dialogue_season1_10406_1_3":"Ahhhh!!","dialogue_season1_10406_1_4":"You fool, wasting the chance I generously gave you.","dialogue_season1_10406_1_5":"I even orchestrated the disguise, using his voice to deceive you into staying.","dialogue_season1_10406_1_6":"The one disguised as the Omniguardian... it's you!","dialogue_season1_10406_1_7":"Like the truth?","dialogue_season1_10406_1_8":"Unfortunately, some are born lowly, only fit to be a <color=#ffa352>pawn</color>.","dialogue_season1_10406_1_9":"No...

I'm not a pawn...","dialogue_season1_10406_1_10":"Stay away from her!","dialogue_season1_10410_1_1":"Bastet seizes the opportunity to tear the mysterious man's arm, but the wound miraculously heals.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_2":"Crafty little mouse...","dialogue_season1_10410_1_3":"However, his power is not as formidable as it appears.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_4":"There's a sense of inconsistency about him.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_5":"Since this is our first encounter, there's no need to get so ugly.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_6":"Why don't we both put down our weapons and resolve this through conversation?","dialogue_season1_10410_1_7":"Your actions have already determined that we have nothing to discuss.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_8":"It's a shame. I thought we could be good brothers.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_9":"After all, we were originally <color=#ffa352>twin souls</color>.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_10":"The mysterious man changes the subject and suddenly launches an attack!","dialogue_season1_10410_1_11":"In the Omniguardian's eyes reflect the suddenly approaching giant sword there's no time to evade!","dialogue_season1_10410_1_12":"Farewell, my <color=#ffa352>reflection</color>.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_13":"No!!!","dialogue_season1_10410_1_14":"Althea collapses, and her final words echo in the Omniguardian's ears.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_15":"Omniguardian, you haven't changed. You're still the person I trusted the most a thousand years ago...","dialogue_season1_10410_1_16":"Even in the face of betrayal, you're willing to offer redemption to a sinner like me...","dialogue_season1_10410_1_17":"Don't speak; you're bleeding!","dialogue_season1_10410_1_18":"Let me see you again... my god, my faith...","dialogue_season1_10410_1_19":"I... <color=#ffa352>ask you to love me, to save me</color>...","dialogue_season1_10410_1_20":"This time, please don't abandon me again.","dialogue_season1_10410_1_21":"The divine blood flows down the blade onto the mysterious man's hand.

Let's take her back.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_17":"But I don't want to share you with anyone else...","dialogue_season1_10415_2_18":"Althea is a patient...","dialogue_season1_10415_2_19":"Bastet's contributions will be remembered.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_20":"Really, I actually wanted to commend you.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_21":"Guiding the lost sheep back to the right path, you're truly remarkable.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_22":"The true heroes are themselves.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_23":"What kind of logic is this?","dialogue_season1_10415_2_24":"When people manage to overcome their past fixations, they naturally find redemption.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_25":"Is that so...","dialogue_season1_10415_2_26":"Then I want to know... what are your fixations?","dialogue_season1_10415_2_27":"I don't know.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_28":"A person without memories won't harbor any fixations.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_29":"Hehe, as expected...","dialogue_season1_10415_2_30":"Bastet's words stir up the Omniguardian's tranquil state of mind, and unfamiliar sentiments begin to spread within him.","dialogue_season1_10415_2_31":"For the first time, the Omniguardian becomes curious about his own past and the world...","dialogue_season1_10416_1_1":"The return of the Python's Mirror has brought a brief stability to Mirlond.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_2":"Now, led by the guard, the Omniguardian meets an old friend who has been waiting for him by the fountain.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_3":"Omniguardian, nice to see you again.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_4":"Althea?","dialogue_season1_10416_1_5":"Your wings have grown out!","dialogue_season1_10416_1_6":"Your purification greatly enhanced the power of the Spring of Eternal Youth, and I was able to fully recover.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_7":"By the way, this outfit... It's what I used to wear when we went out together. Do you still like it?","dialogue_season1_10416_1_8":"It suits you well.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_9":"Thank you.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_10":"Though I came to see you today for a special reason to answer your doubts.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_11":"You're very concerned about the identity of that mysterious man, aren't you?","dialogue_season1_10416_1_12":"Do you know who he is?","dialogue_season1_10416_1_13":"What I'm about to tell you is known only to a few.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_14":"In the <color=#ffa352>War of the Broken Oath</color> a thousand years ago, we joined forces to seal a terrifying existence.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_15":"He's your <color=#ffa352>reflection</color>, a dark consciousness separated from you after being influenced by some powerful force.","dialogue_season1_10416_1_16":"We call him the <color=#ffa352>Dark Omniguardian</color>.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_1":"Dear Sir/Madam,","dialogue_season2_10001_1_2":"Worland Manor cordially requests your presence.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_3":"An interesting game awaits your initiation.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_4":"Here, you shall find lost treasures.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_5":"Looking forward to our meeting.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_6":"Yours sincerely, Worland","dialogue_season2_10001_1_7":"Worland? Inviting you to a game?","dialogue_season2_10001_1_8":"This is suspicious...","dialogue_season2_10001_1_9":"Why do you say that?","dialogue_season2_10001_1_10":"This greedy vampire duke may have stolen a Relic of mine.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_11":"Do you think his invitation has something to do with your Relic?","dialogue_season2_10001_1_12":"Very likely. My Relic keeps calling out to me, and he may have noticed something.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_13":"The scent of roses guides me to accompany you.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_14":"Our destination is on the other side of the Eternal Gate.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_15":"Aiushtha takes the Omniguardian's hand, palms touching.","dialogue_season2_10001_1_16":"Let's go. I want to find out which of my Relics is calling me so urgently.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_1":"Such a splendid estate. Worland seems to have quite the taste.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_2":"If only these riches could enrich my jewelry box.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_3":"You already have plenty.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_4":"Finally, a new story in Itheron! But why invite a chronicler like me to join the game?","dialogue_season2_10101_1_5":"Are you here to participate in the game, too?","dialogue_season2_10101_1_6":"Hmm? Are you... the Doomsday Queen?","dialogue_season2_10101_1_7":"My apologies, Lady Valkyrie, your tale has deeply influenced my work.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_8":"Her tale as the Doomsday Queen?","dialogue_season2_10101_1_9":"Her tale as a Valkyrie?","dialogue_season2_10101_1_10":"The legendary tale of the powerful Doomsday Queen, loyal to the Omniguardian, has been passed down in Palmarius.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_11":"It's a shame, Omniguardian, that the part where I swept you off your feet is missing.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_12":"Omniguardian! You're actually here, too!","dialogue_season2_10101_1_13":"Greetings, Omniguardian, I am Kristine, known as the Emerald Quill.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_14":"I was invited by Duke Worland to document this game.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_15":"And you accepted the invitation? Aren't you afraid to come alone to the estate of a vampire duke?","dialogue_season2_10101_1_16":"The Worland clan is the only one willing to oppose the Abyss among the vampires. I trust Duke Worland's character.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_17":"Now I have even less qualms, because you two are also here.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_18":"Suddenly, a strange sound comes from the grass wall of the estate. Aiushtha smiles and tightens the whip in her hand.","dialogue_season2_10101_1_19":"Our involvement may not necessarily be a good thing. It often attracts trouble.","dialogue_season2_10101_2_1":"Do the Demons not even trust the people they invite?","dialogue_season2_10101_2_2":"No. We don't trust anyone.","dialogue_season2_10101_2_3":"Let's go meet Worland first.","dialogue_season2_10101_2_4":"Okay. I just wanted to remind you: moving forward, it's still wise for us to be cautious.","dialogue_season2_10102_1_1":"In such a luxurious castle, the life of the vampires seems too aloof.","dialogue_season2_10102_1_2":"Why are you tiptoeing?","dialogue_season2_10102_1_3":"Don't you know much about the vampires?","dialogue_season2_10102_1_4":"Vampires are the most reclusive among the Demons. They are mysterious, wealthy, and powerful.","dialogue_season2_10102_1_5":"Look, she's over there.","dialogue_season2_10102_1_6":"In the extravagantly adorned hall, there's a long table. At the head of the table sits a noble vampire, silently gazing at the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10102_1_7":"Is that Duke Worland?","dialogue_season2_10102_1_8":"Are you the Omniguardian?","dialogue_season2_10102_1_9":"Her voice echoes from afar, touching the glass vase nearby with an inexplicable sense of oppression.","dialogue_season2_10102_1_10":"I am...","dialogue_season2_10102_2_1":"Filthy vampire, you can't escape now!","dialogue_season2_10102_2_2":"Gleaming sword light flashing, rose petals shimmering in the moonlight shoot straight towards the duke's heart.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_1":"The rose staff blocks the blade. Immense power clashes, erupting into a bright light, then dissipates into red and white petals.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_2":"Remnant of the Laila clan, are you here to persuade the Worland clan to join the Abyss?","dialogue_season2_10105_1_3":"Lady Elowyn, I believe I explained to you last time. The Laila clan joining the Abyss has nothing to do with me.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_4":"That's a lie you fabricated just to escape. I never believe a vampire's excuse.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_5":"She's not Duke Worland?","dialogue_season2_10105_1_6":"Lady Elowyn hears the voice of the Omniguardian. She neatly sheaths her long sword and bows gracefully.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_7":"Elowyn, the Thornblade from the Seraphic Court, greets the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_8":"Why are you here, Omniguardian?","dialogue_season2_10105_1_9":"Aiushtha winks at the Omniguardian quietly, signaling him not to reveal the true purpose.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_10":"I received an invitation to the game.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_11":"So you received an invitation too... I'm Ophelia the Night Phantom. It's an honor to meet you again.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_12":"Meet me again?","dialogue_season2_10105_1_13":"When I was much younger, you told me this estate had my aura...","dialogue_season2_10105_1_14":"The hall door emits a dull sound—someone else has arrived.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_15":"Did I miss something? It looks like a battle has already taken place?","dialogue_season2_10105_1_16":"Isn't that the Omniguardian? Greetings to you from Wolf Queen Astrid.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_17":"A strong magical fluctuation emanates from below. Crows scatter, and the moonlight outside suddenly changes color.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_18":"The magic light forms a line of words in the air: Players are all here. Esteemed guests, the <color=#ffa352>game has begun</color>.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_19":"Has it started already? I was expecting a more formal opening, like a ritual.","dialogue_season2_10105_1_20":"Something tells me you won't like my kind of ritual...","dialogue_season2_10105_1_21":"There's something going on in the vicinity.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_1":"The crisis disappears instantly. The hall remains magnificent, but this sight makes everyone tense.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_2":"This space is constructed by Worland's magic. He's the best in spells among the vampires.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_3":"Where's Worland? I'm here to discuss cooperation this time.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_4":"Oh? Cooperation? I haven't seen Worland for years. Is he really going to cooperate with the wolf clan?","dialogue_season2_10105_2_5":"Hmph, what are you doing here? The Laila clan has all surrendered to the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_6":"Look over there!","dialogue_season2_10105_2_7":"Kristine's folding fan points to the air in the hall, and mysterious words appear again.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_8":"Find a treasure within the time limit... or kill someone. Failure will be punished with death!","dialogue_season2_10105_2_9":"As if confirming the time limit, the bell in the estate rings. They have only an hour.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_10":"Congratulations, Omniguardian, we've officially entered the game.","dialogue_season2_10105_2_11":"A life-and-death one.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_1":"Considering it's a treasure hunt game, it's best to team up. Aiushtha and Kristine want to team up with Ophelia, who has been here before.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_2":"I'm not here to play the game. I'll go look for Worland.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_3":"The wolves are still waiting for me.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_4":"Watching Astrid's figure entering the west hall alone, Aiushtha seems lost in thought.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_5":"Let's move, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_6":"I also came here with a purpose. It's just strange why Worland would open the gate for me.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_7":"He knew you were coming.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_8":"He hoped you would come.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_9":"That's what I find strange.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_10":"As a member of the <color=#ffa352>Bloodbane Squad</color>, all my training is geared towards combating vampires.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_11":"Before the war against the Abyss, our mission was to hunt down vampires opposed to the Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_12":"The Worland clan is the only one willing to oppose the Abyss among the vampires.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_13":"Never trust vampires. The Worland clan now has only him opposing allegiance to the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_14":"Like Ophelia of the Laila clan, although they haven't joined the Abyss, they will never be loyal to you.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_15":"Could this be your bias?","dialogue_season2_10110_1_16":"...Omniguardian, I'm the last member of the Bloodbane Squad.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_17":"All the others died in battle against the Abyss vampires.","dialogue_season2_10110_1_18":"...","dialogue_season2_10110_1_19":"There's magical fluctuations. Be on guard.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_1":"Elowyn sheathes her sword as the magical creatures disappear into the blooming white roses.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_2":"You are the Omniguardian of this world. Indeed, you should treat everyone fairly.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_3":"But I can't let go of the bias you mentioned.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_4":"Sorry.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_5":"You mentioned you came here with a purpose. Can I help?","dialogue_season2_10110_2_6":"I'm here looking for the Relic you once bestowed upon the Seraphic Court. I want to use it to fight for my fallen comrades.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_7":"A millennium ago, it disappeared alongside the greatest captain of the Bloodbane Squad, in a battle against the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_8":"Lately, I can feel its call. It should be here.","dialogue_season2_10110_2_9":"I'll use it to eradicate the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_1":"Every item in this luxurious castle can be considered a treasure.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_2":"The Omniguardian takes a pair of gem-studded daggers and hands one to Elowyn.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_3":"This is a Relic of the Seraphic Court. The Relic I'm looking for must also have been hidden here by Worland.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_4":"Is this Relic powerful?","dialogue_season2_10115_1_5":"I'm equal in strength to Ophelia. But with this Relic, I can surely defeat her.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_6":"Time is running out. When the Omniguardian arrives at the hall, he sees Aiushtha and Astrid.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_7":"How can these things be called treasures? I don't fancy any of them.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_8":"Lady Aiushtha, you can take this crown I found. It looks perfect on you.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_9":"What about you?","dialogue_season2_10115_1_10":"I have my own treasure.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_11":"Time's almost up, and Kristine hasn't returned yet.","dialogue_season2_10115_1_12":"Lady Aiushtha, why did you let a vampire and an elf team up?","dialogue_season2_10115_1_13":"Do you think as a proud vampire, she would be willing to do so herself?","dialogue_season2_10115_1_14":"Anyway, let's focus on the imminent crisis.","dialogue_season2_10115_2_1":"If Ophelia can't find a treasure, Kristine will be in trouble.","dialogue_season2_10115_2_2":"As lights shimmer, Elowyn strides towards the other end of the hall. Her sense of justice won't allow her to abandon anyone.","dialogue_season2_10115_2_3":"Time is running out. It's too late for you to go search now.","dialogue_season2_10115_2_4":"Argh!","dialogue_season2_10115_2_5":"I... I was attacked.","dialogue_season2_10115_2_6":"Lady Ophelia saved me, but she...","dialogue_season2_10115_2_7":"Boom! A loud noise startles everyone.","dialogue_season2_10115_2_8":"!","dialogue_season2_10201_1_1":"I accidentally triggered a trap, and Ophelia saved me!","dialogue_season2_10201_1_2":"Go check on her quickly!","dialogue_season2_10201_1_3":"I'm fine. That kind of power wasn't enough to harm me.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_4":"Ophelia appears with a gorgeous notebook in hand, red petals from the dispelled magic lightly falling on her elegant skirt.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_5":"Thank goodness you're alright!","dialogue_season2_10201_1_6":"Here, you dropped this treasure. Argh!","dialogue_season2_10201_1_7":"Are you injured?","dialogue_season2_10201_1_8":"Thanks for your concern, but this injury is nothing compared to when I took your sword light last time.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_9":"Where did you find the trap?","dialogue_season2_10201_1_10":"In the study. It's well hidden and likely connects to the underground.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_11":"Perhaps Worland is manipulating magic down there.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_12":"Ding! The bell rings, signaling the end of the first round of the game.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_13":"Ophelia, there are words on your notebook.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_14":"Congratulations everyone, the first round of the game has ended. As for the judgment this time: Everything in the manor belongs to the Duke.","dialogue_season2_10201_1_15":"Those who didn't find anything, prepare for punishment...","dialogue_season2_10201_1_16":"There's a strong magical fluctuation underground. Be careful.","dialogue_season2_10201_2_1":"This judgment is flawed...","dialogue_season2_10201_2_2":"Wait, Astrid, have you given Worland your fang?","dialogue_season2_10201_2_3":"I haven't found... Ah!","dialogue_season2_10201_2_4":"Ahhhh—!","dialogue_season2_10201_2_5":"A surge of magic power instantly fills Astrid's body. A strange sanguine color flashes in her eyes, her strength suddenly becoming frenzied.","dialogue_season2_10201_2_6":"Astrid!","dialogue_season2_10201_2_7":"A rose-colored light flashes. Ophelia tries to stop Astrid, but it's too late.","dialogue_season2_10201_2_8":"Astrid pushes open the castle's heavy door and rushes toward the courtyard.","dialogue_season2_10201_2_9":"Astrid, don't go out!","dialogue_season2_10205_1_1":"The crowd rushes to the courtyard, only to find Astrid hanging on the crescent of the garden's high tower. Her body sways like a puppet off its strings, under the eerie red moon.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_2":"What happened to her? Why is she hanging there?","dialogue_season2_10205_1_3":"Aiushtha tries to approach the tower to get a closer look, but is blocked by a powerful magical force, only able to witness Astrid's plight.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_4":"I can't get any closer, but she seems to have lost her breath.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_5":"We'll have to leave her there for now and make plans after the game is over.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_6":"The vitality of the wolf clan has always been strong. There's something wrong with Worland's magic...","dialogue_season2_10205_1_7":"Is this really a game?","dialogue_season2_10205_1_8":"From the beginning, you should never have trusted the vampires, let alone accept their invitation.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_9":"Ah—!","dialogue_season2_10205_1_10":"Kristine's notebook suddenly flips open, crimson words appearing on the thick and ornate pages.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_11":"The second round begins—find your own treasure within the estate.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_12":"Or kill someone. Please don't deliberately conceal the rules of the game.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_13":"While searching, we should also look for a way to lift the spell.","dialogue_season2_10205_1_14":"I've been here before. There are some mazes in the estate. I can guide you if you want.","dialogue_season2_10205_2_1":"Affected by the spell, this estate, filled with red and white roses, becomes increasingly eerie, and magical creatures appear more frequently.","dialogue_season2_10205_2_2":"Are there really treasures here that belong to us?","dialogue_season2_10205_2_3":"We are not the host, so we can't decide the rules.","dialogue_season2_10205_2_4":"Given that Aiushtha was reluctant to reveal her purpose for this journey, the Omniguardian has to deflect the question.","dialogue_season2_10205_2_5":"Truth be told—I came here because I felt a calling.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_1":"Ophelia gazes at the vampire duke's castle, which emits an ominous atmosphere under the dark red moon.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_2":"As you've said, there's an aura of mine here. There must be something that belongs to me.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_3":"Inside Worland's estate, what could possibly belong to you?","dialogue_season2_10210_1_4":"Perhaps it's this estate full of roses?","dialogue_season2_10210_1_5":"Admitting it may undermine the status of the Laila clan, but I do need a place to stay.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_6":"What happened to the Laila clan's territory?","dialogue_season2_10210_1_7":"The land is still there, but what remains there is nothing more than a group of corrupted beings controlled by desire.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_8":"Now, wherever I am, the Laila clan is there too.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_9":"Boom! A loud noise echoes from the other end of the garden, shaking the ground.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_10":"This estate is not peaceful. It might not be a good place to live.","dialogue_season2_10210_1_11":"Let's deal with the present crisis first.","dialogue_season2_10210_2_1":"A strong beam of light flashes, white rose petals flying from afar, dissipating at Ophelia's fingertips.","dialogue_season2_10210_2_2":"It's Elowyn's sword light. She must be attacking with all her might.","dialogue_season2_10210_2_3":"How did you know?","dialogue_season2_10210_2_4":"We've fought many times before, both of us giving our all to try to end the other.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_1":"A grand golden light illuminates the courtyard, Elowyn hacking away at a thicket of magical brambles.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_2":"You're going to get entangled!","dialogue_season2_10215_1_3":"Don't go there, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_4":"The Omniguardian is about to approach but is held back by Aiushtha.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_5":"Only Elowyn's sword aura can dispel the thorns. Anyone else who gets close will be harmed.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_6":"I'm no exception.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_7":"Why is she trying to cut through the thorns?","dialogue_season2_10215_1_8":"To find her treasure.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_9":"Amidst the explosively growing thicket, the glimmer of gems flashes, a magnificent crown entwined within.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_10":"Is that...","dialogue_season2_10215_1_11":"Don't go, Ophelia!","dialogue_season2_10215_1_12":"It's calling out to me.","dialogue_season2_10215_1_13":"The rosy figure is instantly engulfed by the thorns, entangled amidst the frenzy of golden light.","dialogue_season2_10215_2_1":"Interesting. The powers of a Demon and a Divine have actually merged.","dialogue_season2_10215_2_2":"Because they have fought many times and come to understand each other's powers well enough.","dialogue_season2_10215_2_3":"A powerful surge of magic disperses the blooming roses. Elowyn and Ophelia finally approach the crown amidst the thorns.","dialogue_season2_10215_2_4":"Back off, Demon!","dialogue_season2_10215_2_5":"You have no authority to command me.","dialogue_season2_10215_2_6":"Amidst the swirling roses, both of them who feel the calling reach out simultaneously towards the crown entwined in thorns.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_1":"The dazzling golden-red light blooms, and a wave of ancient and distant magical energy disperses, causing the massive brambles to vanish.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_2":"Something's awakening.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_3":"This power is related to you, but it's very complex.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_4":"With a clang, the magnificent crown falls onto the stone table. Everyone is surprised to see Elowyn and Ophelia holding a whip together.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_5":"Is this... a treasure of the Seraphic Court?","dialogue_season2_10301_1_6":"It's the <color=#ffa352>Demonbane Whip</color>.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_7":"Wha... what?","dialogue_season2_10301_1_8":"Ophelia's usually composed and elegant expression shows a hint of disbelief as she instinctively takes a step back and releases the whip from her hand.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_9":"Wait...","dialogue_season2_10301_1_10":"As Ophelia releases the whip, its glow fades, reverting back to thorns and entwining the crown once again.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_11":"That's interesting.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_12":"W... what is that?","dialogue_season2_10301_1_13":"From the dissipating thorns emerges a pair of blood-red eyes. With a low growl, the creature suddenly roars and lunges toward Kristine.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_14":"Danger! It's a vampire beast!","dialogue_season2_10301_1_15":"Elowyn barely withstands the beast's attack. She struggles to summon the Demonbane Scourge but is overwhelmed.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_16":"Be careful, Elowyn.","dialogue_season2_10301_1_17":"Instinctively, Ophelia grasps the thorns, awakening the Demonbane Scourge together with Elowyn. With a fierce force, they wield it against the vampire beast.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_1":"As the beast disperses, the two who were holding the Demonbane Scourge simultaneously release their grip. The whip reverts to its thorn-like form.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_2":"...","dialogue_season2_10301_2_3":"Alright, stop staring at me, Lady Elowyn. You're hurting me.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_4":"Demon... No, Duchess, you aided me.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_5":"So, you remember my esteemed status.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_6":"Titles and status mean nothing. There's no way a vampire can summon the Demonbane Scourge to battle.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_7":"Since titles and status mean nothing, of course I can summon it as well.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_8":"Both of you try summoning it, but not at the same time. Let's see who can awaken it.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_9":"Nope, I don't want to.","dialogue_season2_10301_2_10":"That makes two of us.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_1":"Just give it a try. This Relic might just help you both complete the game.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_2":"Ophelia steps forward and attempts to summon the thorns, but they only tremble slightly, unfolding into a red rose.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_3":"Hmph, playing tricks. How can a divine Relic obey your summons? Let me try instead.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_4":"Elowyn reaches out, the golden thorns on her arm wrapping around the vines. After a faint golden glow gathers, only a white rose remains.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_5":"It seems you haven't awakened it either.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_6":"You can try awakening it together.","dialogue_season2_10305_1_7":"...","dialogue_season2_10305_1_8":"Watch out around you, more vampire beasts are closing in again!","dialogue_season2_10305_1_9":"Omniguardian, protect your own power. Your power is your treasure.","dialogue_season2_10305_2_1":"In the midst of powerful magic, the encountered monsters grow stronger. Aiushtha seems to have not yet found her Relic.","dialogue_season2_10305_2_2":"Aiushtha, have you sensed the location of your Relic?","dialogue_season2_10305_2_3":"Of course. We're already very close to it.","dialogue_season2_10305_2_4":"Are you hiding something from me?","dialogue_season2_10305_2_5":"Omniguardian, I have no secrets from you.","dialogue_season2_10305_2_6":"It's just that this game is not as simple as we thought.","dialogue_season2_10305_2_7":"I've found something!","dialogue_season2_10310_1_1":"Kristine raises the notebook in her hand, the one Ophelia found earlier.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_2":"This should be Worland's notebook, and I've discovered a story.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_3":"Our elf chronicler finally found the time to tell a story.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_4":"Over 1200 years ago, a Divine from the Bloodbane Squad and Duchess Laila from a vampire clan fell in love during numerous clashes.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_5":"Such a legendary story, and I didn't know about it?","dialogue_season2_10310_1_6":"However, when the Motaya Abyss opened, they both died in battle against the Abyss, using their last strength to seal the Demonbane Scourge aimed at the vampires.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_7":"Wow, the power of true love can overcome everything. Omniguardian, can you give me such affection?","dialogue_season2_10310_1_8":"...Is there any mention of how to break the seal? We need the power of the Relic now.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_9":"Hmm, let me see...","dialogue_season2_10310_1_10":"Surprisingly, there really are vampires willing to oppose the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_11":"Of course. I wouldn't allow pure blood to be tainted by the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_12":"There's a note here: <color=#ffa352>Seeking a Blood Slayer willing to tread the thorns together</color>.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_13":"I can't bring myself to summon the Relic together with a vampire.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_14":"Quite an objective sentiment. It's also difficult for me to summon something that slaughtered my kind.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_15":"Perhaps the moment to break down the barriers in our hearts is coming.","dialogue_season2_10310_1_16":"Before that, let's clear out the monsters around us.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_1":"I've found their weak spot.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_2":"I'll go for the breakthrough.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_3":"My roses will protect you.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_4":"Red and white roses entwine to slay the monsters, but this battle unsettles Aiushtha.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_5":"These creatures are ferocious. Omniguardian, the energy of this spell is corrupted.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_6":"We need stronger power.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_7":"Awaken the Demonbane Scourge to dispel the threat before us.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_8":"You all came here following your callings, and you have a common enemy.","dialogue_season2_10310_2_9":"Use the Relic to fight together.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_1":"Perhaps I really need to focus on dealing with the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_2":"I'm glad to hear that, Your Grace. I can finally bathe in the moonlight with peace of mind.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_3":"Vampires are cunning by nature. I'll still keep an eye on you.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_4":"If you both are willing, we can combine your strengths to repel the Abyss together.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_5":"Let's get to it. I just hope your power won't burn me.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_6":"They both grasp the thorns entwined around the crown. A warm, divine power surges into the Omniguardian's body as radiant light shimmers.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_7":"Ding! As the Relic is activated, the exquisite crown falls.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_8":"Omniguardian, please go and fetch the crown. We can complete this round of the game.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_9":"—!!! No!!!","dialogue_season2_10315_1_10":"There's a spell on the Relic. It's Worland's curse!","dialogue_season2_10315_1_11":"Traitor of the vampires! You will be forever imprisoned by my curse!","dialogue_season2_10315_1_12":"—!!!","dialogue_season2_10315_1_13":"Worland's voice echoes throughout the estate. The ground suddenly trembles violently as countless red bat eyes light up in the dark night.","dialogue_season2_10315_1_14":"Omniguardian!","dialogue_season2_10315_2_1":"The once elegant estate is now filled with flying dust. Bricks and stones instantly crack open, revealing sinister tombstones amidst roses and thorns.","dialogue_season2_10315_2_2":"Countless vampires awaken from the underground coffins, swarming toward the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10315_2_3":"This... this isn't a game, nor is it a good story.","dialogue_season2_10315_2_4":"Omniguardian, this isn't the power of the vampires.","dialogue_season2_10315_2_5":"It's the Abyss!","dialogue_season2_10315_2_6":"Ah—!","dialogue_season2_10315_2_7":"Ophelia!!","dialogue_season2_10315_2_8":"A massive coffin opens from below, countless thorns binding her hands and feet, as a sudden immense force strikes Ophelia.","dialogue_season2_10315_3_1":"Ahhhh—!","dialogue_season2_10315_3_2":"The Abyss attacked Ophelia! She's been corrupted!","dialogue_season2_10401_1_1":"Amidst the chaos, the magnificent crown falls to the ground, rolling toward a massive crevice.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_2":"Don't lose the crown!","dialogue_season2_10401_1_3":"Omniguardian, look out!","dialogue_season2_10401_1_4":"I've got it!","dialogue_season2_10401_1_5":"A mass of huge thorns separates the sight of the three. They can only see intense light flashing amidst the vines.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_6":"I can't break free from such a strong curse. Don't waste time on me.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_7":"Ah, it's been so long since I tasted blood...","dialogue_season2_10401_1_8":"Under the corruption of the Abyss's power, Ophelia struggles to maintain consciousness, her desire for blood overcoming all reason.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_9":"Lady Elowyn, could you share with me your blood? It has the scent of roses...","dialogue_season2_10401_1_10":"Outrageous request! How could I possibly use my own blood to save a vampire.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_11":"Since you're corrupted, you can't give up the craving for blood, I should...","dialogue_season2_10401_1_12":"Ophelia fights with all her might against the curse. She begins to regain consciousness.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_13":"Ugh... Use the Relic to kill me.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_14":"I'll infuse my power into it. Then you take it and fight the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_15":"Snap out of it!","dialogue_season2_10401_1_16":"My head is clear now. The dignity and nobility of a vampire... don't allow me to beg for blood like this.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_17":"Ophelia struggles to stand straight, traces of corruption from the Abyss already appearing on the arm gripping the staff.","dialogue_season2_10401_1_18":"No, I won't leave you.","dialogue_season2_10401_2_1":"Amidst the fluttering rose petals and spreading golden light, there are nothing but the wailing vampires.","dialogue_season2_10401_2_2":"Why are these filthy creatures gathering here?","dialogue_season2_10401_2_3":"They've caught the scent of my blood. Elowyn! Get away!","dialogue_season2_10401_2_4":"Ophelia's magic bursts with immense energy. She exhausts herself to shield Elowyn from a huge cloud of blood.","dialogue_season2_10401_2_5":"Argh!! Was that Worland?","dialogue_season2_10401_2_6":"These two are troublesome.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_1":"Kristine grits her teeth as she retrieves the crown from under the vampire bodies, carefully handing it to the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_2":"Omniguardian, my strength is running out. The strong smell of blood is suffocating me.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_3":"It's an illusion brought by the vampire spell.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_4":"Omniguardian, we're in trouble.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_5":"The Worland clan has probably already fallen. Its spell is being exploited by the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_6":"The fluctuations of the spell are intense. This game is coming to an end.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_7":"Omniguardian, give me the crown. This is what I came here for.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_8":"It's my Relic—my crown when I was the \"Doomsday Queen.\"","dialogue_season2_10405_1_9":"Then why didn't you reclaim it when you first saw it earlier?","dialogue_season2_10405_1_10":"The power of doom is always hinting at hidden dangers around me. I couldn't simply reveal my purpose.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_11":"Ophelia!! Why?!","dialogue_season2_10405_1_12":"Aiushtha furrows her brows as she hears the cry from the other end of the thorns.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_13":"No time to think about anything else. I need to activate the crown to boost my strength.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_14":"I'll watch your back while you're at it.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_15":"Aiushtha's power envelops the magnificent crown. In an instant, the power of doom is activated.","dialogue_season2_10405_1_16":"Aiushtha, watch your step!","dialogue_season2_10405_2_1":"The power of Doomsdayers is unleashed. The ground in the garden splits apart completely as strong fluctuations clash with the spell.","dialogue_season2_10405_2_2":"Boom! The entire garden plummets downward.","dialogue_season2_10405_2_3":"Are we underground?","dialogue_season2_10405_2_4":"Thank you, Omniguardian. Your power is comforting.","dialogue_season2_10405_2_5":"As everyone falls, the Omniguardian struggles to shield Aiushtha and Kristine.","dialogue_season2_10405_2_6":"Your crown...","dialogue_season2_10405_2_7":"Intense red light bursts before the Omniguardian's eyes, as a powerful force rushes toward the crown.","dialogue_season2_10405_2_8":"Strike! The power of doom!","dialogue_season2_10405_3_1":"A familiar voice comes from above. The dark clouds disperse, and the Omniguardian sees who it is.","dialogue_season2_10405_3_2":"Astrid?!!","dialogue_season2_10410_1_1":"Little Wolf Queen, what are you up to?!","dialogue_season2_10410_1_2":"Oh no! I missed...","dialogue_season2_10410_1_3":"Aiushtha's power blocks Astrid's full-force strike, but her pack of wolves swarms in and snatches the crown.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_4":"Astrid? Resurrected?","dialogue_season2_10410_1_5":"In the distance, Elowyn is assisting Ophelia from the thorns, not minding them piercing her own skin.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_6":"Not resurrected... This is vampire magic. Astrid probably never died in the first place.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_7":"Thank you all for earnestly participating in the game and helping me solve so many troubles.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_8":"Astrid gives a mocking bow.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_9":"Though the rules were a bit tiresome to design, obtaining the power of doom is still worth it.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_10":"You designed this?!","dialogue_season2_10410_1_11":"Just my power alone wouldn't be enough to trap all of you. Thankfully, I have a good ally.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_12":"Worland?","dialogue_season2_10410_1_13":"Hahaha, him?","dialogue_season2_10410_1_14":"Worland mocked my wolf heritage, but now his body serves me. Quite satisfying indeed.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_15":"Worland's body? What have you done to him?","dialogue_season2_10410_1_16":"Greedy and selfish people only face betrayal. Worland was killed by his own trusted clan.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_17":"That can't be. Only Worland's power can activate these powerful spells.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_18":"Could he be possessed...?","dialogue_season2_10410_1_19":"Haha, Worland's power, and the Valkyric Power of Doomsdayers, will all be mine.","dialogue_season2_10410_1_20":"Everyone, be cautious. The spell underground is even more challenging to deal with!","dialogue_season2_10410_2_1":"The wolves will conquer the entire continent!","dialogue_season2_10410_2_2":"Omniguardian, Astrid isn't herself.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_3":"She's tainted with the scent of the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_4":"I think I know what happened. Astrid teamed up with someone else, someone who had taken over Worland's body and devoured his power.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_5":"That is correct! No wonder they say you've heard all the stories on the continent.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_6":"I invited you here to help these fools find clues, but Astrid surprised me... She's just too amazing.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_7":"A shadowy figure appears beside Astrid, casually taking the crown.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_8":"Our cooperation has been successful. Now, release the power of doom. I need it.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_9":"Worland... No, he is...","dialogue_season2_10410_2_10":"Hello, everyone. Are you enjoying this game? Have you all found your treasures?","dialogue_season2_10410_2_11":"Well, now they will all belong to me.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_12":"Including you, Omniguardian, my reflection.","dialogue_season2_10410_2_13":"You're the Dark Omniguardian!","dialogue_season2_10414_1_1":"Amidst the powerful spell, the Dark Omniguardian, who has absorbed Worland's power, unleashes tremendous force, plunging everyone into a fierce battle.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_2":"Dark Omniguardian... Your target was the Omniguardian all along!","dialogue_season2_10414_1_3":"Of course. How could Worland's body contain my power?","dialogue_season2_10414_1_4":"I sensed your cunning, but I didn't expect you to be so eager even before the game was over.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_5":"You're smart, Astrid. Thank you for your help.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_6":"No need to sugarcoat it. You're just using her.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_7":"You've corrupted her and this estate with the power of the Abyss.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_8":"You're too soft, my reflection.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_9":"Utilizing everyone's desires reasonably is what makes this game interesting.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_10":"Ugh!","dialogue_season2_10414_1_11":"Astrid, calm down. You've given him too much time to absorb Worland's power. We need to think of a way out.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_12":"Oh no! He now has the power of the crown too.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_13":"Worland is a vampire.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_14":"The Relic belongs to Aiushtha.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_15":"I'll use all my strength to slay the vampires who have joined the Abyss. That is my mission.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_16":"Elowyn... Awaken the whip with my power.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_17":"But you've exhausted all your strength...","dialogue_season2_10414_1_18":"Ophelia shakes her head. Her hands gradually wither as she grips the Demonbane Scourge, her last drops of blood falling upon it.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_19":"The Demonbane Scourge soars into the air, and Ophelia collapses.","dialogue_season2_10414_1_20":"I, Elowyn the Thornblade, will punish the Abyss carrying the power of Ophelia the Night Phantom!","dialogue_season2_10414_1_21":"Together, we will protect everyone.","dialogue_season2_10414_2_1":"The Omniguardian cleaves through the spell, and the Demonbane Scourge binds Worland's body.","dialogue_season2_10414_2_2":"Thank you, Omniguardian. I can feel your power gradually awakening.","dialogue_season2_10414_2_3":"Why? The power within the crown... Why does it no longer serve me?!","dialogue_season2_10414_2_4":"Aiushtha finally seizes the Dark Omniguardian's vulnerability and retrieves her crown.","dialogue_season2_10414_2_5":"Because it doesn't belong to you!","dialogue_season2_10415_1_1":"The crown is called the Crimson Doom.","dialogue_season2_10415_1_2":"Therefore, it can only belong to me, the Doomsday Queen.","dialogue_season2_10415_1_3":"Aiushtha places the crown on her head, provocatively glaring at the Dark Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10415_1_4":"Dark Omniguardian, your plan has failed, and this game should be over now.","dialogue_season2_10415_1_5":"Hehehehe... Hahahaha... You've actually ruined such an interesting game.","dialogue_season2_10415_1_6":"Worland's body dissipates, and the figure of the Dark Omniguardian appears before everyone.","dialogue_season2_10415_1_7":"Then let everything end here. You will all end with the game!","dialogue_season2_10415_1_8":"Come. I'll return doubly the pain you caused!","dialogue_season2_10415_2_1":"Your power seems to have increased.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_2":"The game is not over yet. When we meet again, you won't be so lucky.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_3":"The Crimson Doom erupts with immense power. With a full-force strike from the Omniguardian, the Dark Omniguardian dissipates into black mist.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_4":"...It's still not the real him.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_5":"Another clone of his? We need to hurry and find the lost Relics to restore our strength.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_6":"Lady Elowyn!","dialogue_season2_10415_2_7":"The powerful curse and the corruption of the Abyss have almost consumed Ophelia. Without hesitation, Lady Elowyn wields her sword...","dialogue_season2_10415_2_8":"Her blood drips from her wrist, falling onto Ophelia's tightly closed lips.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_9":"The Demon blood usually corrodes Divines, but she has exhausted all her blood for us.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_10":"I can't let her die!","dialogue_season2_10415_2_11":"Let me awaken her.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_12":"The Omniguardian grasps Ophelia's cold arm, the warm Oath Force slowly flowing into her body.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_13":"Ugh...","dialogue_season2_10415_2_14":"Why does it taste like sunshine in my mouth? So bitter.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_15":"She's awake! That's great.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_16":"This game should have a happy ending.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_17":"Phew, she seems to be fine.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_18":"We can't underestimate Worland's curse.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_19":"Are you saying you'll keep healing her?","dialogue_season2_10415_2_20":"Then I'd rather be weaker! That way, you can heal me more.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_21":"I'll also have more time to conquer you.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_22":"I don't want you to get hurt.","dialogue_season2_10415_2_23":"Then become even stronger. Be my Omniguardian forever and ever!","dialogue_season2_10416_1_1":"Because of the return of the Demonbane Scourge and the Crimson Doom, the Abyss vampires are gradually retreating in the battle.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_2":"Territories once corrupted have found new owners and continue to prosper, like the former Worland Manor.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_3":"Elowyn helped me reclaim the territory occupied by the Abyss, and Lady Ophelia lent me a large sum of money.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_4":"It seems I haven't completely lost the game after all.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_5":"Because you chose the right side in the end.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_6":"Haha, I won't be easily driven by desires from now on.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_7":"Thank you for inviting me to join the Royals. I'll rally the strength of the wolves to fight for you.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_8":"This place suits you better.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_9":"My wolves brought me news that the real Dark Omniguardian is not currently in Itheron.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_10":"Then where is he?","dialogue_season2_10416_1_11":"Still sealed away.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_12":"The Omniguardian walks into the manor, deep in thought. Lady Ophelia hasn't fully recovered, so he'll continue to eliminate the curse's power for her.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_13":"But as soon as he arrives at the hall, the Omniguardian hears Elowyn's voice.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_14":"The Omniguardian is coming to treat you. Hurry back to your room—the sunlight will burn you.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_15":"*yawns* I'm feeling sleepy. Thank you, Elowyn. I feel safe with you around.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_16":"...I'm staying only because I find the white roses here beautiful in the sunlight.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_17":"Though your blood is bitter, it's enough for me to share everything with you.","dialogue_season2_10416_1_18":"Including the sunlight and white roses here.","dialogue_season2_10416_2_1":"Good morning.","dialogue_season2_10416_2_2":"Omni... Omniguardian!","dialogue_season2_10416_2_3":"You're here early again..","dialogue_season2_10416_2_4":"They were once alone in this world, but now, they have more than just each other.","dialogue_season2_10501_1_1":"Wrapped in the fragrance of rose, a game invitation guides the Omniguardians to the Eternal Gate.","dialogue_season2_10501_1_2":"Omniguardian, have you heard its call?","dialogue_season2_10501_1_3":"What have you discovered?","dialogue_season2_10501_1_4":"It's the return of our <color=#ffa352>Eternal Relic</color>.","dialogue_season2_10501_1_5":"The return of the relic will significantly enhance the power against the abyss.","dialogue_season2_10501_1_6":"Let's cross the Eternal Gate together, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season2_10501_1_7":"Go to the lost land of the relic and see what has happened there.","dialogue_main_10311_1_10":"Ugh... Everyone, please don't come any closer!","dialogue_main_10311_1_11":"We've fallen into a trap.","dialogue_main_10311_1_12":"I'll come to rescue you.","dialogue_main_10311_1_13":"Accursed invaders... be gone!","dialogue_main_10311_2_8":"In the silence as still as death, there seems to be a faint breath rising and falling.","dialogue_main_10311_2_9":"What are you waiting for? I'll clear the way!","dialogue_main_10315_1_9":"Prepare for battle.","dialogue_main_10315_2_13":"Thank you, Eluller.","dialogue_season3_10001_1_1":"The activities of the Dark Omniguardian are becoming more frequent. We must hasten our search for the Relics.","dialogue_season3_10001_1_2":"Each Relic that remains unfound could potentially become a tool to strengthen its power.","dialogue_season3_10001_1_3":"Aiushtha and the others have already retrieved their Relics. I can sense it...","dialogue_season3_10001_1_4":"The Forbidden Chest, lost during the calamity in Itheron, once fought alongside me. I feel its faint call from a distant place.","dialogue_season3_10001_1_5":"This time, I will personally step through that Eternal Gate, to pursue that lost power, to answer that ancient call.","dialogue_season3_10001_1_6":"Omniguardian, will you be by my side?","dialogue_season3_10001_1_7":"It would be my honor.","dialogue_season3_10101_1_1":"We're stationed here.","dialogue_season3_10101_1_2":"We live here.","dialogue_season3_10101_1_3":"We die here.","dialogue_season3_10101_1_4":"There's no restriction preventing us from leaving.","dialogue_season3_10101_1_5":"What truly keeps us here is duty.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_1":"Never thought we'd end up here...","dialogue_season3_10101_2_2":"Do you know where this is?","dialogue_season3_10101_2_3":"Of course. It has a nice name called \"Eureka.\"","dialogue_season3_10101_2_4":"Eureka used to be the base of the Void Hunters, where those brave warriors once swore to defend our world to the death.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_5":"Void Hunters?","dialogue_season3_10101_2_6":"They were elite warriors who once served under your command. To seal the Void Rifts, they sacrificed everything they had.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_7":"It was because of their steadfastness and sacrifice that the Void creatures from beyond the world were unable to invade us.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_8":"However, since the shattering of Itheron, we lost contact with this land and these brave warriors.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_9":"I truly hope they're all still safe.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_10":"Dorabella suddenly snaps out of her thoughts, frowning.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_11":"But why would the Forbidden Chest appear here?","dialogue_season3_10101_2_12":"The Eternal Gate has never been wrong.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_13":"Indeed, since it led us here, the Forbidden Chest must be nearby.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_14":"Then, let's go find those Void Hunters next.","dialogue_season3_10101_2_15":"I believe, with their help, we can surely find the Relic more quickly.","dialogue_season3_10101_3_1":"Void creatures appearing so close to Eureka?","dialogue_season3_10101_3_2":"Could it be that the Void Hunters have already...","dialogue_season3_10101_3_3":"It's indeed a possibility. After all, it's been a thousand years since the shattering of Itheron.","dialogue_season3_10101_3_4":"So much can change in such a long time.","dialogue_season3_10101_3_5":"Perhaps Eureka and the Void Hunters have encountered mishaps, or perhaps they've found new ways to deal with the threat of Void creatures.","dialogue_season3_10101_3_6":"The situation here may have exceeded our current understanding.","dialogue_season3_10101_3_7":"But regardless, we must go into the city of Eureka to find out.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_1":"Dorabella suddenly pulls the Omniguardian down with alertness, her gaze sharp as she gestures for him to look ahead. There, two figures are tensely facing off, the air thick with a sense of impending conflict.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_2":"I've finally found you.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_3":"It's you? How can you be here? You should be forever banished within the rift!","dialogue_season3_10105_1_4":"How I returned isn't important. What matters is, today, you will meet your end here.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_5":"You want to... kill me?","dialogue_season3_10105_1_6":"Stop!","dialogue_season3_10105_1_7":"Huh? Omniguardian, wait up!","dialogue_season3_10105_1_8":"Consider yourself lucky.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_9":"As her words fall, the space before them fractures like glass, and Leandra's figure disappears into the distorted space.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_10":"Whew... Thank you so much. I'm Halysa.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_11":"However, Dorabella doesn't relax her vigilance, frowning as she surveys their surroundings.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_12":"Now's not the time to let our guard down. The spatial fluctuations just now may have alerted those Void creatures.","dialogue_season3_10105_1_13":"They could be on their way here now. We must deal with these potential threats first.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_1":"The threat from these Void creatures has finally been resolved. For now at least.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_2":"Dorabella eyes Halysa with curiosity.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_3":"Are you a Void Hunter? Why haven't I seen you before?","dialogue_season3_10105_2_4":"I joined the Void Hunters after the shattering of Itheron.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_5":"Dorabella nods, still somewhat skeptical. Halysa notices this and immediately produces her emblem, handing it to Dorabella.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_6":"The emblem Halysa offers bears the symbol of the Void, its lines flowing and imbued with power. After careful observation, Dorabella confirms its authenticity.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_7":"Indeed, it's the emblem of the Void.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_8":"And Audrey? Is she alright? I haven't heard from her in a long time.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_9":"Not too good. Since the shattering of Itheron, the Void Hunters have lost the support of the Covenant Temple, and our days have become increasingly difficult.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_10":"People keep dying, yet the seal here always needs someone to attend to it.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_11":"That's why I joined the Void Hunters.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_12":"Audrey has been working hard to maintain our team, but her body and spirit have been under immense pressure.","dialogue_season3_10105_2_13":"Alright, then please take us to see Audrey.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_1":"Audrey, I'm back!","dialogue_season3_10110_1_2":"You're later than expected. Has the seal on the Void Rift loosened again?","dialogue_season3_10110_1_3":"Yes. And on my way back, I was intercepted by Leandra.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_4":"Leandra? How could she escape from the Void Rift?","dialogue_season3_10110_1_5":"I'm not sure, but luckily, I met them.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_6":"She gestures behind her, and the Omniguardian and Dorabella walk in. The Omniguardian nods slightly to Audrey, while Dorabella smiles and waves.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_7":"Do you know them?","dialogue_season3_10110_1_8":"Of course, I do.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_9":"My dear Audrey, are you surprised to see us?","dialogue_season3_10110_1_10":"You're still as cheerful as ever. Can't you be more serious after a thousand years?","dialogue_season3_10110_1_11":"Omniguardian... It's been a long time.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_12":"The Omniguardian looks at Audrey, a hint of confusion in his eyes.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_13":"...","dialogue_season3_10110_1_14":"Due to some reasons, the Omniguardian's memory is a bit fragmented. When he first woke up, he didn't even remember me.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_15":"How could this happen? What happened?","dialogue_season3_10110_1_16":"It's a long story. Let's about it later. We're mainly here this time to find the Forbidden Chest.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_17":"I guessed when I saw you. But you're really not coming at a good time...","dialogue_season3_10110_1_18":"Before she finishes, Halysa urgently interrupts their reunion.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_19":"Audrey! It's not good. The rifts have appeared inside the city!","dialogue_season3_10110_1_20":"We'll talk about the Relic later. I must deal with this invasion of Void creatures first.","dialogue_season3_10110_1_21":"I'll help too!","dialogue_season3_10110_2_1":"The Void Rifts appearing within the city, you've really been through a lot in these thousand years.","dialogue_season3_10110_2_2":"It's all part of the duty. There's no such thing as being through a lot.","dialogue_season3_10110_2_3":"The Forbidden Chest went missing.","dialogue_season3_10110_2_4":"How could that happen? I sensed its presence when I arrived!","dialogue_season3_10110_2_5":"Yes, the chest was indeed in this area, but it's no longer in my possession.","dialogue_season3_10110_2_6":"You'll understand the specifics when you see the sealing site with me.","dialogue_season3_10110_2_7":"What exactly happened...","dialogue_season3_10115_1_1":"Audrey, accompanied by Dorabella and Halysa, arrives at the sealing site in Eureka.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_2":"This is where the Forbidden Chest was stored.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_3":"So, you used the chest as the core of the seal to reinforce it?","dialogue_season3_10115_1_4":"That's right. It's the method you taught me back then.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_5":"Using the power of the Relic to enhance the stability of the seal is indeed very effective.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_6":"The seal here is connected to the main seal of the Void Rift.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_7":"If the seal here is damaged, it affects the main seal, causing the Void Rifts to appear frequently.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_8":"So that's why there have been frequent Void Rift appearances lately.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_9":"Since the Relic went missing, the seal here has been damaged, leading to the appearance of the Void Rifts within the city.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_10":"And the situation is getting worse. We can hardly predict when and where the rifts will appear now.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_11":"As she speaks, a Void Rift suddenly cracks open near the sealing site. Massive Void creatures emerge from it, roaring as they charge towards everyone.","dialogue_season3_10115_1_12":"Can't these Void creatures let us talk in peace?","dialogue_season3_10115_2_1":"So, what exactly is this seal meant to contain?","dialogue_season3_10115_2_2":"It's not what, but rather whom. You're the one who banished her, remember?","dialogue_season3_10115_2_3":"Her?!","dialogue_season3_10115_2_4":"Who are you talking about?","dialogue_season3_10115_2_5":"A Demon who once committed a grave mistake. And you gave the order to banish her.","dialogue_season3_10115_2_6":"Do you still remember Narissa?","dialogue_season3_10115_2_7":"I'm afraid not.","dialogue_season3_10115_2_8":"Suddenly, a Void Rift slowly opens, and Leandra's figure emerges from it.","dialogue_season3_10115_2_9":"Halysa! Be careful!","dialogue_season3_10115_3_1":"The weakened spatial power has greatly facilitated my actions.","dialogue_season3_10115_3_2":"I told you I'd stop you.","dialogue_season3_10115_3_3":"Leandra, you...!","dialogue_season3_10115_3_4":"Foolish. Luckily the Void Hunters have existed for such a long time.","dialogue_season3_10115_3_5":"You'll thank me later.","dialogue_season3_10115_3_6":"With that, she disappears again into the Void, leaving everyone staring at each other. Audrey quickly crouches down to provide a simple treatment for the injured Halysa.","dialogue_season3_10115_3_7":"Halysa, hang in there. I'll go find the Void Crystals to remove the Void energy from you.","dialogue_season3_10115_3_8":"Let's head back to Eureka first.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_1":"After settling the injured Halysa, Audrey, Dorabella, and the Omniguardian quickly move outside the city of Eureka to search for the precious Void Crystals.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_2":"Void Crystals... I remember they were primarily used as magical materials. When did they become capable of healing wounds?","dialogue_season3_10201_1_3":"In our prolonged battle against the Void, we've had to explore various methods to counter its threats.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_4":"About 600 years ago, we discovered that Void energy exhibits a significant aggregating effect.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_5":"By utilizing this effect, we can gather and expel residual Void energy from wounds using Void Crystals, effectively treating injuries.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_6":"This discovery greatly reduced our casualty rate, making our battle against the Void more manageable.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_7":"So, for us, Void Crystals are not just magical materials but also life-saving medicine.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_8":"Dorabella listens silently, filled with respect for Audrey and the Void Hunters' dedication and efforts. She looks up at Audrey, her eyes shining with determination.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_9":"I understand now.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_10":"No need to make that face. I've said before, it's all part of our duty.","dialogue_season3_10201_1_11":"Now, let's find those Void Crystals.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_1":"After carefully searching, Dorabella finally discovers an area rich in Void Crystals. Excitedly, she gathers a sufficient amount of crystals.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_2":"Well, these Void Crystals should be enough for Halysa's treatment. We can head back to heal her.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_3":"On the way back, Dorabella suddenly remembers the encounter with Leandra earlier and asks curiously.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_4":"Was that Leandra who attacked us?","dialogue_season3_10201_2_5":"I remember her. When we banished Narissa, she chose to follow Narissa into the Void.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_6":"That's her. But she looked... different. Were you surprised to see her like that?","dialogue_season3_10201_2_7":"That's the result of being corrupted by Void energy. Both her body and mind have been twisted by it.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_8":"Void energy is considered taboo because it gradually makes people indifferent to life and loses their humanity.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_9":"After a moment of silence, Dorabella voices her thoughts.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_10":"While I'm not sure how Leandra escaped the seal, I can't shake the feeling that it's somehow related to the loss of the Relic. What do you think?","dialogue_season3_10201_2_11":"I have a similar intuition. However, our priority now is to treat Halysa.","dialogue_season3_10201_2_12":"We can discuss the Relic and Leandra later.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_1":"On the way back, dappled sunlight filters through the treetops, but this tranquility is shattered by the sudden appearance of a blade.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_2":"Leandra, the Demon once banished, now stands before the trio, her gaze cold and resolute.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_3":"Hand over the Void Crystals, or leave your lives here.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_4":"When you were banished, Halysa hadn't even joined the Void Hunters.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_5":"Why such animosity towards her?","dialogue_season3_10205_1_6":"Leandra remains silent. She only gazes distantly at the ever-twisting, rhythmic Void Rift.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_7":"After a while, she withdraws her gaze slowly, and takes a deep breath, as if making some kind of decision.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_8":"The clock is ticking.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_9":"Audrey stares fearlessly at Leandra, her sword tightly gripped, ready to respond to any potential attack.","dialogue_season3_10205_1_10":"Are you going to make a move? That suits me just fine.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_1":"True to form as the leader of the Void Hunters, just not the brightest bulb in the box.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_2":"Your blade isn't as sharp as your tongue.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_3":"Seeing the standoff, Dorabella remains composed, attempting to extract more information from Leandra.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_4":"Did you leave the Void by using the power of the Forbidden Chest?","dialogue_season3_10205_2_5":"Yes.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_6":"Where is it now? Did you see it when you left the Void?","dialogue_season3_10205_2_7":"Who knows? When I broke free from the Void, I didn't see the chest.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_8":"That's impossible! The chest is the core of the seal. If you escaped the Void, you couldn't have missed it.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_9":"Heh, you Void Hunters always think you know it all. Not teaming up with you was the right choice.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_10":"She suddenly brandishes her blade, and a massive Void Rift appears before the trio in an instant. As the rift closes, Leandra's figure vanishes without a trace.","dialogue_season3_10205_2_11":"After her!","dialogue_season3_10210_1_1":"Give up, Leandra. You can't escape.","dialogue_season3_10210_1_2":"You've already been wounded by us before, so there's no point in resisting further.","dialogue_season3_10210_1_3":"We can help you purge the Void energy from your body and set you back on the right path.","dialogue_season3_10210_1_4":"Being injured by you was only because I didn't want to truly harm you.","dialogue_season3_10210_1_5":"Do you really think that after being corrupted by the Void for a thousand years, I only have this much power?","dialogue_season3_10210_1_6":"Are you still unwilling to surrender? Since you're so confident, let me truly test your strength.","dialogue_season3_10210_2_1":"Leandra pants, clearly exhausted from the battle. She looks up at Audrey, her eyes flashing with stubbornness and reluctance.","dialogue_season3_10210_2_2":"Phew... phew...","dialogue_season3_10210_2_3":"How about now? Can we talk properly?","dialogue_season3_10210_2_4":"I told you, I didn't take the Forbidden Chest. It was Narissa. She took it.","dialogue_season3_10210_2_5":"Narissa?","dialogue_season3_10210_2_6":"Yes, the one I mentioned earlier, who was banished because of a grave mistake.","dialogue_season3_10210_2_8":"But she's sealed in the Void Temple. How could she possibly escape?","dialogue_season3_10210_2_9":"She may not be able to come out, but she can rely on someone else.","dialogue_season3_10210_2_10":"Someone else? You mean Halysa?","dialogue_season3_10210_2_11":"Why do you think I would take such a big risk to assassinate her?","dialogue_season3_10210_2_12":"That's impossible! Halysa is one of us. She wouldn't betray us.","dialogue_season3_10210_2_13":"Haha, you're too naive. Come with me to a place. When we get there, you'll know everything.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_1":"Under Leandra's lead, the group arrives at a secluded valley. In the valley, a familiar figure stands with her back turned, alone.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_2":"Audrey, seeing the figure, is shaken. She slowly approaches, wanting to confirm the person's identity.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_3":"Leandra, your relentless assassination attempt suggests you've already discovered this place.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_4":"Did you take the Forbidden Chest?","dialogue_season3_10215_1_5":"Obviously.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_6":"Why? Why would you do this?","dialogue_season3_10215_1_7":"Leandra senses the Void energy emanating from Halysa and suddenly realizes.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_8":"You... you're not one of Narissa's minions; you are Narissa!","dialogue_season3_10215_1_9":"Does it matter who I am?","dialogue_season3_10215_1_10":"Shouldn't you be worried about the Void creatures about to flood into this world and the increasingly frequent Void Rifts?","dialogue_season3_10215_1_11":"You!","dialogue_season3_10215_1_12":"Halysa gently waves her hand, and a Void Rift suddenly appears before them. From the rift, a horde of Void creatures emerges, roaring as they charge towards the group.","dialogue_season3_10215_1_13":"Have some fun with them.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_1":"They take a brief moment to regroup before hastily rushing towards Halysa, or should we say, the direction where Narissa departed.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_2":"Halysa holds an item shimmering with a mysterious glow, the very Forbidden Chest they've been searching for.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_3":"This identity is no longer needed.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_4":"She's holding... the Forbidden Chest?!","dialogue_season3_10215_2_5":"Exactly, Dorabella. This is your Relic, and it's also the key to my escape.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_6":"Her body gradually transforms in the light, eventually revealing another visage, the true face of Narissa.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_7":"Long time no see, everyone.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_8":"Narissa! You're not getting away from here!","dialogue_season3_10215_2_9":"Want to keep me here? Are you sure about that?","dialogue_season3_10215_2_10":"She smiles and shifts slightly to her left, revealing a weak figure corroded by Void energy. It's the real Halysa.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_11":"Choose now, keep me, or save Halysa?","dialogue_season3_10215_2_12":"I will kill you for sure!","dialogue_season3_10215_2_13":"It seems you've made your choice. Then, goodbye, everyone.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_14":"Watching Narissa's departing figure, Audrey grits her teeth. She walks up to Halysa, her scythe slashing through, crystallizing the surrounding Void energy instantly, then shattering layer by layer.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_15":"She holds Halysa tightly, feeling her body's weakness and trembling.","dialogue_season3_10215_2_16":"Let's go. We're heading back to Eureka!","dialogue_season3_10301_1_1":"Audrey carefully lays Halysa down on the ground, ensuring she can lie comfortably. After a while, Halysa slowly opens her eyes and sees familiar faces around her. She offers a weak smile.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_2":"You're awake. How are you feeling? Be careful, the Void energy hasn't been completely expelled yet.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_3":"I have some Void Crystals here that can help you recover.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_4":"Thank you.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_5":"Dorabella gingerly places the Void Crystals on Halysa's wound. As the purple Void energy flows into the crystals, their color gradually deepens, seeming to devour all darkness.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_6":"Ah, I feel much better now.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_7":"That's good. What happened earlier? How did you encounter Narissa?","dialogue_season3_10301_1_8":"There was a major outbreak of Void Rifts earlier. Just as I finished dealing with a wave of Void creatures and was in a weakened state, she suddenly appeared.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_9":"So she took advantage of the situation to disguise herself as you and infiltrate Eureka, stealing the Forbidden Chest from the sealing chamber.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_10":"What? Then the seal...","dialogue_season3_10301_1_11":"Yes, with its core stolen, the seal probably won't hold for much longer.","dialogue_season3_10301_1_12":"We have to face the consequences of the seal breaking and quickly figure out a way to reseal the Void Rift.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_1":"The frequency of these small Void Rifts appearing is increasing, which is not a good sign.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_2":"This is the consequence of the main seal loosening. We must take action quickly, or the situation will spiral out of control.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_3":"She pauses for a moment, seeming to ponder something.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_4":"There's one thing I can't figure out. How did Narissa escape from the Void Temple when the seal was intact? It doesn't seem possible.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_5":"Hmm, I remember now. Narissa's condition seemed off.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_6":"What have you remembered?","dialogue_season3_10301_2_7":"She didn't choose to kill me at the time, but instead used Void energy to seal and corrupt.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_8":"I suspect it's because her power wasn't sufficient at that moment to kill me.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_9":"So, you mean she wasn't in a complete state? That would explain how she escaped from the Void Temple.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_10":"I see... She must have used Void energy to create a clone and then possessed a Void creature.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_11":"When the Void creatures passed through the Void Rift, her clone entered Eureka along with them.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_12":"That's quite clever.","dialogue_season3_10301_2_13":"Now is not the time for astonishment. We need to return to Eureka immediately to discuss our strategy.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_1":"They return to the city. Audrey mobilizes people for active preparation, while Dorabella looks at Leandra, who shows little expression.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_2":"Leandra, weren't you originally a loyal follower of Narissa? But now...","dialogue_season3_10305_1_3":"I didn't want to defy her either, but she's not the same Narissa anymore.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_4":"It's all because of you, and the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_5":"Because of us?","dialogue_season3_10305_1_6":"Back then, Narissa created the largest Void Rift in the world here, bringing great disaster to the continent.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_7":"Banishing her to the Void Temple was a reasonable decision, except you left her there for too long.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_8":"About that... When the Abyss invaded, Itheron shattered, and we were struggling to survive ourselves...","dialogue_season3_10305_1_9":"When I secretly returned here, I quickly learned about these situations, but Narissa didn't.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_10":"She had been constantly corroded by the Void power in the Void Temple. In the first few years, she could barely maintain her sanity.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_11":"But over the years, left forgotten in the Void Temple for a millennium, her mind has long been consumed by hatred.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_12":"She should be able to fully control those Void creatures now. Her return is just for revenge.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_13":"Her power is growing stronger and may have even surpassed her former self.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_14":"As her former follower, I don't want to see her like this.","dialogue_season3_10305_1_15":"I understand. We can stop her. Will you join us?","dialogue_season3_10305_1_16":"...Alright.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_1":"Continuing like this isn't an option. We're always on the defensive while Void Rifts keep multiplying.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_2":"I believe we should take the initiative, seek out Narissa, and thwart her plans.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_3":"I agree. If we continue waiting here, we'll only be overwhelmed by more Void Rifts and creatures.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_4":"Let the other Void Hunters stay and keep clearing out the emerging Void creatures and rifts within the city.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_5":"The rest of us will head to the seal site, locate Narissa, and stop her.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_6":"Omniguardian, what do you think? Is this plan feasible?","dialogue_season3_10305_2_7":"We have no other choice for now.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_8":"There's no time to waste. Let's move out now. Every minute we delay could mean more Void Rifts appearing.","dialogue_season3_10305_2_9":"The group swiftly gathers their gear and supplies, ready to head to the seal site in search of Narissa.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_1":"Facing the dense array of small Void Rifts ahead, they feel an unprecedented pressure.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_2":"These rifts seem to bear witness to Narissa's frenzied power, constantly spewing out Void creatures, threatening the safety of the entire Itheron.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_3":"The seal has begun to loosen on a large scale, the situation worse than we anticipated.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_4":"The frequency and scale of these Void Rifts are continually increasing. We must act quickly.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_5":"With so many Void creatures, can we really stop her? Her power seems beyond control.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_6":"We have to try; we can't just give up like this.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_7":"There are still unarmed civilians in Eureka, counting on our protection. We can't let them down, nor can we let the entire Itheron fall into jeopardy.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_8":"Though these lower-level Void creatures are numerous, they cannot stop our advance.","dialogue_season3_10310_1_9":"We need to pass through here quickly, heading to the seal site.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_1":"The crowd stares nervously at the Void Rift in the distance, watching as it begins to violently tremble, distorting the air around it.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_2":"The sealing array starts to crack like fragile glass, emitting sharp, rupturing sounds, each echoing like a blow to the hearts of the onlookers.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_3":"Has it begun already? We need to get there as soon as possible.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_4":"Maybe I shouldn't have treated her like that when she broke the seal for the first time.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_5":"Broke the seal for the first time? What do you mean?","dialogue_season3_10310_2_6":"Shortly after Itheron shattered, Narissa once broke the seal.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_7":"At that time, she hadn't been completely corrupted by Void energy.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_8":"Yes, back then, Narissa was powerful, but she hadn't completely lost her sanity.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_9":"I didn't know any of this back then... I only knew that after that breach of the seal, Void creatures flooded Eureka, plunging it into chaos.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_10":"To protect Eureka, I sealed her into the Void once again. The Forbidden Chest was used to reinforce the seal after that incident.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_11":"There's no point in dwelling on that now; our priority is to stop her.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_12":"Let's hurry over; the Void creatures along the way are increasing in number.","dialogue_season3_10310_2_13":"If we delay any longer, we might face even greater difficulties.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_1":"Narissa stands before the Void Rift, sneering at the approaching crowd. Her eyes betray deep resentment and arrogance, as if she has been waiting for this moment for a long time.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_2":"So, you've finally come. But alas, you're too late.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_3":"Narissa... Don't let hatred blind you.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_4":"Have you forgotten why you joined the Covenant Temple, fighting alongside us?","dialogue_season3_10315_1_5":"A complex expression briefly flickers across Narissa's face, swiftly replaced by deeper resentment.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_6":"I'm tired of those clichés about sacrificing oneself for others.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_7":"Now, I only seek to live for myself.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_8":"Her gaze suddenly shifts to Leandra, filled with reproach and anger.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_9":"And you, Leandra, I never thought you'd betray me.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_10":"I pledge allegiance to the old Narissa, the brave, kind-hearted fighter for life that you once were.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_11":"Betrayal is betrayal! Don't make excuses.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_12":"With a wave of her hand, Narissa summons a horde of Void creatures.","dialogue_season3_10315_1_13":"Very well, let my pets, tamed by me, send you on your way!","dialogue_season3_10315_1_14":"At Narissa's command, the Void creatures launch a fierce attack on the crowd.","dialogue_season3_10315_2_1":"Narissa coldly observes the fallen Void creatures on the ground, a hint of dissatisfaction crossing her face. Then, she turns to the crowd, a mocking smile playing at the corners of her mouth.","dialogue_season3_10315_2_2":"To think you could defeat my carefully nurtured pets. Truly, you are among the finest on the continent.","dialogue_season3_10315_2_3":"But alas, you cannot stop me!","dialogue_season3_10315_2_4":"With those words, she reaches for the mysterious Forbidden Chest. The chest emits an eerie glow, as if containing boundless power. With a gentle touch, Narissa slowly opens it.","dialogue_season3_10315_3_1":"Feel the power of the Void. It will replace the Oath Force and become the sole force on this continent!","dialogue_season3_10401_1_1":"Audrey stares at the fully open Void Rift, her tone heavy.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_2":"The Void Rift is fully open now. This is really bad.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_3":"Halysa surveys the surroundings, watching the endless stream of Void creatures pouring out of the rift, a worried expression on her face.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_4":"What do we do? With our current numbers and strength as Void Hunters, we can't possibly contend with these Void creatures!","dialogue_season3_10401_1_5":"Narissa is now the queen of the Void, and these creatures are all under her control.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_6":"If we can defeat her, perhaps we can change the situation and bring a ray of hope to Itheron.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_7":"Are you suggesting we enter the Void Temple?","dialogue_season3_10401_1_8":"Yes.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_9":"I agree. Only by defeating Narissa can we turn the tide.","dialogue_season3_10401_1_10":"And now, entering the Void Temple is our only way out. There, we might find the opportunity to battle her.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_1":"After entering the Void, the group nervously eyes the colossal structure ahead.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_2":"The creatures inside are much more powerful...","dialogue_season3_10401_2_3":"Due to the constraints of the Eternal Oath, these extraneous beings are usually suppressed when they enter our continent.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_4":"But now, the situation is quite the opposite.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_5":"This also means that our path ahead will become increasingly arduous.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_6":"If you're afraid, you can turn back. Without you, I'll still stop her!","dialogue_season3_10401_2_7":"I have to say, the way you speak really gets on my nerves.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_8":"Anyway, the Omniguardian and I won't back down.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_9":"We'll keep moving forward until we defeat Narissa and close the Void Rifts.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_10":"The Void Hunters don't have deserters.","dialogue_season3_10401_2_11":"Very well.","dialogue_season3_10405_1_1":"Narissa hovers high in the Void Temple, sneering at the intruders who have entered her palace.","dialogue_season3_10405_1_2":"Do you dare to enter my palace? You truly have a death wish.","dialogue_season3_10405_1_3":"This isn't Itheron; it belongs to my Void realm!","dialogue_season3_10405_1_4":"As she speaks, the surrounding Void creatures begin to stir, roaring as they charge towards the group.","dialogue_season3_10405_1_5":"Void creatures keep coming! Everyone, be careful!","dialogue_season3_10405_1_6":"Narissa's eyes reveal arrogance and cruelty, as if she already has the fate of everyone firmly in her grasp.","dialogue_season3_10405_1_7":"Since you're here, endure my wrath!","dialogue_season3_10405_1_8":"Breakthrough! We can't afford to be surrounded here.","dialogue_season3_10405_2_1":"Watching the people successfully deal with the Void creatures, Narissa's face betrays a hint of complex emotion.","dialogue_season3_10405_2_2":"You... you're always like this!","dialogue_season3_10405_2_3":"Now you want to show off your friendship and bonds? How ridiculous!","dialogue_season3_10405_2_4":"What about me? Am I not your friend?","dialogue_season3_10405_2_5":"We fought side by side, and faced countless challenges together, but where were you when I was in trouble?","dialogue_season3_10405_2_6":"Why didn't you come to rescue me then? I endured torment in the Void while you enjoyed so-called peace in Itheron.","dialogue_season3_10405_2_7":"You... you all deserve to die!","dialogue_season3_10410_1_1":"Audrey takes a deep breath and gazes at Narissa ahead.","dialogue_season3_10410_1_2":"We're finally here, Narissa.","dialogue_season3_10410_1_3":"It's not too late to turn back now. We can still fight side by side like we used to.","dialogue_season3_10410_1_4":"I've already said, that this is my territory!","dialogue_season3_10410_1_5":"Do you think you can still turn the tables here?","dialogue_season3_10410_1_6":"Looking at Narissa's arrogant and cruel smile, Leandra can't help but feel a sinking feeling in her heart.","dialogue_season3_10410_1_7":"In this state, she won't listen to us.","dialogue_season3_10410_1_8":"Audrey nods in response, a determined glint flashing in her eyes.","dialogue_season3_10410_1_9":"Then let's make her yield with our strength!","dialogue_season3_10410_2_1":"Narissa lets out a soft hum, her body seeming to tremble slightly, her complexion turning somewhat pale.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_2":"Uh...","dialogue_season3_10410_2_3":"Narissa, come back with us. You don't belong here. The Void Temple is not your home.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_4":"Go back? How can I go back? I've already merged with this Void Temple, inseparable.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_5":"Narissa looks up at the endless Void before her, as if recalling something.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_6":"If it were a thousand years ago, perhaps I could still leave, but now, it's really too late.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_7":"Narissa withdraws her gaze from the Void, her eyes turning cold.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_8":"Besides, do you really think you've defeated me?","dialogue_season3_10410_2_9":"Uh-oh, she's absorbing the power of the Void Temple!","dialogue_season3_10410_2_10":"Everyone can see energy gathering around Narissa, as if the power of the Void Temple is being continuously absorbed into her body.","dialogue_season3_10410_2_11":"We need to stop her!","dialogue_season3_10415_1_1":"Narissa, now fully infused with power, hovers at the center of the Void Temple, surrounded by potent Void energy.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_2":"I am the Void incarnate!","dialogue_season3_10415_1_3":"And this place, the Void Temple, shall become your tomb.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_4":"Audrey gazes at Narissa's overwhelming aura, feeling a pang of unease.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_5":"She's even more powerful now. Perhaps this time, we might not make it out alive.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_6":"Are you speaking defeat already? Aren't you a Void Hunter who has always fought against the Void?","dialogue_season3_10415_1_7":"I'm just stating the facts. Look at her power; it far exceeds our expectations.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_8":"No, we can bring her home. Right, Omniguardian?","dialogue_season3_10415_1_9":"Absolutely.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_10":"Audrey looks at Dorabella and the Omniguardian, their resolute expressions filling her with determination.","dialogue_season3_10415_1_11":"You're right. I can't give up. Let's get ready!","dialogue_season3_10415_1_12":"Together, we'll strive to pull Narissa out of the darkness of the Void.","dialogue_season3_10415_2_1":"A few days later...","dialogue_season3_10415_3_1":"In the morning light of Eureka, Narissa, who has been brought back, slowly regains consciousness. Her eyes flutter slightly, as if trying to adjust to the surroundings.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_2":"Audrey, Dorabella, and Leandra approach eagerly, watching her with concern.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_3":"Narissa, you're finally awake.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_4":"What... happened to me?","dialogue_season3_10415_3_5":"You were consumed by the power of the Void, and lost yourself.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_6":"During your slumber, we used Void Crystals to gradually remove the Void energy from your body, hoping to aid your recovery.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_7":"Unfortunately, we couldn't fully expel that power; it had already penetrated too deeply.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_8":"But the fact that you've regained your sanity is the best news for us.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_9":"No need. I can feel it. The remaining Void energy in my body is no longer enough to control my mind.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_10":"This power can now enhance my abilities to some extent, and...","dialogue_season3_10415_3_11":"I hope it will constantly remind me of everything that happened before, and remind me that I still have you all.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_12":"Narissa...","dialogue_season3_10415_3_13":"Alright, alright. Now the most important thing is to let Narissa rest well.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_14":"When she's recovered, we'll return to Mythoria together.","dialogue_season3_10415_3_15":"Yes... and the Forbidden Chest has been successfully retrieved too. I'd say this journey has come to a satisfying end!","dialogue_season3_10210_2_7":"She was the leader of the Void Summoners, but due to excessive exposure to Void energy, led to a disaster, so we had to banish her.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_1":"Omniguardian, during the Abyss invasion, I lost my most important Relic, the Exorcism Cauldron.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_2":"When it comes to devouring monsters, no other Relic is as powerful.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_3":"Since losing the Exorcism Cauldron, my strength has greatly diminished, and I can hardly fulfill my duties as a Guardian Valkyrie.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_4":"It's all my fault... I fear that I have let you down and failed everyone who held hope.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_5":"But just now, I suddenly sensed its location again.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_6":"The Exorcism Cauldron has been reactivated somewhere beyond the Eternal Gate, in a region entirely unknown to me.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_7":"For the sake of peace on the continent, I have the responsibility to go. Will you accompany me?","dialogue_season4_10001_1_8":"Of course.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_9":"I am very glad you are willing to stand by my side at this critical moment.","dialogue_season4_10001_1_10":"Let us reclaim the lost Exorcism Cauldron together.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_1":"After the Omniguardian and Elune pass through the Eternal Gate, a strange scene accompanied by an aura of killing rushes straight at them.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_2":"*Squeak*","dialogue_season4_10101_1_3":"Surprisingly, the two find themselves in a battlefield!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_4":"Omniguardian, be careful! These monsters exude the aura of the Abyss.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_5":"But... who are they fighting against?","dialogue_season4_10101_1_6":"*Roar*","dialogue_season4_10101_1_7":"Elune's distraction gives the enemies an opportunity, as hideous monsters brandish their claws!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_8":"Elune, danger!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_9":"Whew...","dialogue_season4_10101_1_10":"Thankfully, you're by my side, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_11":"Who dares to challenge the might of my Golden Cudgel?","dialogue_season4_10101_1_12":"After a fierce roar, a strong gust of wind strikes, but the Omniguardian catches it bare-handed!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_13":"Oh? Not bad.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_14":"This is... a stick?","dialogue_season4_10101_1_15":"It's not a stick! This is my precious Golden Cudgel. Give it back!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_16":"As if possessing a mind of its own, the Golden Cudgel suddenly slips from Omniguardian's palm and flies towards the spot with the most monsters gathered.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_17":"The next moment, the monsters are effortlessly pushed aside, and a figure emerges from the midst of the crowd.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_18":"I'm busy! If you don't want to get involved in the fight, then hurry up and leave!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_19":"Omniguardian, he's the one fighting the Abyss monsters.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_20":"His power belongs to the Divines.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_21":"But his appearance... doesn't look anything like a Divine.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_22":"And he also... exudes the aura of the Abyss. He's at least corrupted by it.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_23":"What Divines? Although I may have forgotten some things, don't try to fool me.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_24":"The Omniguardian has never been wrong... What should we do?","dialogue_season4_10101_1_25":"Help him first.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_26":"Eliminate the Abyss monsters.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_27":"Well, these Abyss creatures are his enemies, so perhaps he could become our ally.","dialogue_season4_10101_1_28":"Aren't you leaving yet?!","dialogue_season4_10101_1_29":"What? Do you want to help?","dialogue_season4_10101_1_30":"Do as you please, but remember, stay sharp, and don't slow me down!","dialogue_season4_10101_2_1":"Phew, finally done...","dialogue_season4_10101_2_2":"I must say, you guys can really hold your own in a fight.","dialogue_season4_10101_2_3":"I've faced some tough opponents before, but how come I've never seen you?","dialogue_season4_10101_2_4":"I guess that's no surprise. Even if we've met before, I wouldn't remember.","dialogue_season4_10101_2_5":"So, what should we call you?","dialogue_season4_10101_2_6":"I... I am...","dialogue_season4_10101_2_7":"...Wukong.","dialogue_season4_10101_2_8":"That should be my name.","dialogue_season4_10101_2_9":"My mind is blank... Ugh!","dialogue_season4_10101_2_10":"A sudden sharp pain interrupts Wukong's words. He clutches his head, arching in agony.","dialogue_season4_10101_2_11":"Omniguardian, the Abyss aura around him suddenly intensified!","dialogue_season4_10101_2_12":"Kill... Kill! Kill!! Kill!!!","dialogue_season4_10105_1_1":"Kill... Kill! Kill!! Kill!!!","dialogue_season4_10105_1_2":"No... Shut up! I won't lose to this evil thought!","dialogue_season4_10105_1_3":"Wukong looks terrifying. Some irresistible evil thought is eroding his consciousness.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_4":"Calm down.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_5":"The Omniguardian, using the Omnideus, manages to control the extent of Wukong's corruption.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_6":"My head... it doesn't hurt anymore? What is this power of yours?","dialogue_season4_10105_1_7":"The Omniguardian's power can temporarily suppress the Abyss corruption.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_8":"Never heard of such power... Anyway, what are you here for?","dialogue_season4_10105_1_9":"The Omniguardian and I are here to retrieve the Eternal Relic...","dialogue_season4_10105_1_10":"After listening to Elune's explanation, Wukong furrows his brow.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_11":"The Exorcism Cauldron? Never heard of it.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_12":"But I do remember a place. It seems to have hidden treasures... I might have been there before. Perhaps that's where your cauldron is.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_13":"Can you point us in the right direction?","dialogue_season4_10105_1_14":"If I knew the way, I wouldn't be wandering around here. In fact, I also...","dialogue_season4_10105_1_15":"*Roar*","dialogue_season4_10105_1_16":"Unnoticed, the three are already surrounded by monsters.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_17":"The nerve of them!","dialogue_season4_10105_1_18":"Wukong impatiently scratches the back of his neck.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_19":"Are you going there too? What kind of place is it?","dialogue_season4_10105_1_20":"Hmm, now's not the time for chatter...","dialogue_season4_10105_1_21":"I suppose I can tell you. It's the last thing I remember.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_22":"I'm going back to the Seraphic Court. It's also your destination.","dialogue_season4_10105_1_23":"Don't ask me why. I don't remember anything. But the one thing I can't forget is this thought.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_1":"I must go back. Even if my head feels like it's about to explode, I must return to the Seraphic Court!","dialogue_season4_10105_2_2":"What about you?","dialogue_season4_10105_2_3":"Elune and the Omniguardian exchange a glance, immediately reaching a conclusion.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_4":"We will accompany you and help you return to the Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_5":"Just like that? Not even asking for anything in return?","dialogue_season4_10105_2_6":"We were planning to go to the Seraphic Court anyway, to retrieve the Exorcism Cauldron.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_7":"Having you by our side will only help.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_8":"I suppose. I've had enough of always fighting alone, too.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_9":"As Wukong speaks, he suddenly throws the Golden Cudgel toward the bamboo forest next to him.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_10":"Come out!","dialogue_season4_10105_2_11":"Omniguardian, there's someone in the bamboo forest.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_12":"Calm down. Patience is key to success.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_13":"A tall figure in a blue robe, holding a staff, emerges from the bamboo forest.","dialogue_season4_10105_2_14":"You are trespassing, yet you still dare to speak ill of me?","dialogue_season4_10105_2_15":"He's a... panda?!","dialogue_season4_10110_1_1":"The panda bows gracefully, his expression calm and serene.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_2":"I am Lee.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_3":"It was not my intention to startle you.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_4":"You say this is your home? Are you trying to rob us or something?","dialogue_season4_10110_1_5":"Young warrior, have you recently been feeling frequent chest tightness, dry mouth, and even emotional outbursts?","dialogue_season4_10110_1_6":"Huh? How did you... Wait, are you pretending to be some kind of mystic?","dialogue_season4_10110_1_7":"You have an inner demon; it is restraining your power.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_8":"This Eastern paradise is similar to you, being corrupted by the Abyss.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_9":"Although the change is slow, over time, it has caused great suffering to many beings.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_10":"At this moment, a rustling sound comes from the grass beside them.","dialogue_season4_10110_1_11":"Omniguardian, it's the aura of monsters!","dialogue_season4_10110_1_12":"Hmph, your home sure is popular. Everyone, stand aside! I've got some pent-up anger to release!","dialogue_season4_10110_2_1":"The Abyss has already corrupted the bamboo forest...","dialogue_season4_10110_2_2":"It seems the Seraphic Court won't hold out much longer.","dialogue_season4_10110_2_3":"Do you know where the Seraphic Court is?","dialogue_season4_10110_2_4":"To reach the Seraphic Court, you must first ascend the celestial ladder.","dialogue_season4_10110_2_5":"Before that, you will encounter many enemies and face numerous obstacles...","dialogue_season4_10110_2_6":"What is there to fear about enemies and difficulties? As long as I can retrieve what I've lost, I don't care how hard it is!","dialogue_season4_10110_2_7":"I observed your battle just now; you indeed possess exceptional strength, which puts me at ease.","dialogue_season4_10110_2_8":"But you must understand, that so-called enemies are not necessarily others.","dialogue_season4_10110_2_9":"Are you saying that my greatest enemy is myself?","dialogue_season4_10110_2_10":"I hope you can overcome the corruption and restore your divinity and strength.","dialogue_season4_10110_2_11":"Divinity... Could this guy really be a Divine?","dialogue_season4_10110_2_12":"This is not only for you but also for the preservation of this paradise.","dialogue_season4_10115_1_1":"Let me see... It should be in this direction... Wait, there's movement in the bushes!","dialogue_season4_10115_1_2":"...","dialogue_season4_10115_1_3":"Oh, sorry. I've mixed up all the directions... Hey, don't you dare run!","dialogue_season4_10115_1_4":"...","dialogue_season4_10115_1_5":"One last time. Bear with me, it must be right this time. Take this!","dialogue_season4_10115_2_1":"As they search for the celestial ladder, the group helps Lee clear out many monsters lurking in the bamboo forest.","dialogue_season4_10115_2_2":"Hey old man, enough is enough!","dialogue_season4_10115_2_3":"We're here. This time for real.","dialogue_season4_10115_2_4":"Lee calmly avoids Wukong's Golden Cudgel, revealing the majestic celestial ladder coiled behind him like a dragon.","dialogue_season4_10115_2_5":"Climb it, and you'll see the Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season4_10115_2_6":"Why, aren't you coming up with us?","dialogue_season4_10115_2_7":"I still need to guard the bamboo forest.","dialogue_season4_10115_2_8":"But remember...","dialogue_season4_10115_2_9":"Save your breath. We're leaving!","dialogue_season4_10115_2_10":"Sigh, young people are too impatient. Let me finish.","dialogue_season4_10115_2_11":"Climbing this celestial ladder is not as simple as you might think. You must be vigilant... It's a test...","dialogue_season4_10115_2_12":"But Wukong has already rushed ahead onto the celestial ladder, his figure growing more distant until it is swallowed by a sudden shower of peach blossoms.","dialogue_season4_10201_1_1":"The celestial ladder soars into the clouds. Wukong is solely focused on the scenery above, completely oblivious to Lee's warnings.","dialogue_season4_10201_1_2":"We're almost there! Ah, enemies!","dialogue_season4_10201_1_3":"Who are these guys?","dialogue_season4_10201_1_4":"Judging by their looks, they're celestial beings.","dialogue_season4_10201_1_5":"Do they want to hinder us? Then they can't blame me for not showing mercy. Ugh!","dialogue_season4_10201_1_6":"The demonic nature surges again. Wukong lets out a painful and suppressed expression.","dialogue_season4_10201_1_7":"Damn it! Not now!","dialogue_season4_10201_1_8":"Omniguardian, these celestial beings can affect the seal of the Omnideus on the demonic nature!","dialogue_season4_10201_1_9":"I'll reinforce the seal. You all get ready for battle!","dialogue_season4_10201_1_10":"Yes!","dialogue_season4_10201_2_1":"We're almost at the end of the celestial ladder!","dialogue_season4_10201_2_2":"This is...","dialogue_season4_10201_2_3":"As the group arrives at the top of the celestial ladder, what they see is not the majestic Seraphic Court, but a picturesque peach blossom grove.","dialogue_season4_10201_2_4":"Oh my, we have visitors.","dialogue_season4_10201_2_5":"Could you come closer for me to have a look?","dialogue_season4_10201_2_6":"Before seeing anyone, the sound of tinkling laughter grabs everyone's attention.","dialogue_season4_10201_2_7":"Seems like there's someone under the peach blossom tree.","dialogue_season4_10201_2_8":"Let's go take a look.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_1":"The three walk into the grove and finally encounter the fox-tailed woman lounging under the flowers.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_2":"I'm Dahlia.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_3":"A meeting like this must be fate. Would you three care to join me in admiring this peach blossom paradise?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_4":"Dahlia rises gracefully, her movements stirring the fragrant air, and gestures for the three to accompany her.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_5":"Dahlia, where are you taking us?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_6":"You've come from afar. Isn't it for this Peach Blossom Paradise?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_7":"Peach Blossom Paradise?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_8":"Oh my, you look so familiar, like the one I've been longing for...","dialogue_season4_10205_1_9":"Dahlia leans closer to the Omniguardian, her eyes shimmering.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_10":"Could you leave behind the mundane world and spend some time with me here?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_11":"Ahem, Dahlia! This is the Omniguardian!","dialogue_season4_10205_1_12":"I'm delighted to have more companions.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_13":"This Peach Blossom Paradise is where I cultivate my elegance.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_14":"Dear guests, allow me to explain...","dialogue_season4_10205_1_15":"As the peach blossoms reflect each other, the group continues deeper into the grove.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_16":"Do you live here?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_17":"Yes. I adore peach blossoms, so I planted this grove myself, hoping to share it with like-minded souls.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_18":"But this place has nurtured quite a few monsters.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_19":"Wukong points to a peach tree, where a small creature resembling a peach blossom scurries into the shadows.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_20":"These are Peach Blossom Spirits.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_21":"I must confess, though I planted the grove, I haven't had the energy to maintain it properly.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_22":"That's no trouble with us here. Those little spirits are as good as captured.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_23":"Oh, if you're not in a hurry...","dialogue_season4_10205_1_24":"Of course, we... um...","dialogue_season4_10205_1_25":"Elune briefly shows a puzzled expression.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_26":"Omniguardian, what are we here for?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_27":"Um...?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_28":"I remember. You've come to have fun with me.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_29":"Ah, yes. How could I forget?","dialogue_season4_10205_1_30":"The reputation of the Peach Blossom Paradise precedes it. Today, my wish has been fulfilled.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_31":"I'm pleased to hear it. Well then, please assist me in clearing out the Peach Blossom Spirits.","dialogue_season4_10205_1_32":"(It seems like something's not quite right. What are we forgetting?)","dialogue_season4_10205_1_33":"Please follow me. The paradise is even grander than you've seen.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_1":"Thank you. With your help, the peach blossom grove has finally returned to its original tranquility.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_2":"Don't mention it.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_3":"As the group prepares to rest for a moment, a sudden gust of wind stirs up the blossoms, captivating their senses.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_4":"Oh my, the grove often experiences these little gusts. Please, stay close to me...","dialogue_season4_10210_1_5":"And whatever you do, don't lose sight of me.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_6":"A shower of peach blossoms momentarily blinds the group. When they open their eyes, it's as if they've entered a pond of peach blossoms.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_7":"Huh?!","dialogue_season4_10210_1_8":"Two Dahlias?!","dialogue_season4_10210_1_9":"Huh?","dialogue_season4_10210_1_10":"For a Peach Blossom Spirit, you have some nerve, daring to impersonate the owner of the grove!","dialogue_season4_10210_1_11":"Ugh...","dialogue_season4_10210_1_12":"One is the real Dahlia, and the other is a Peach Blossom Spirit...","dialogue_season4_10210_1_13":"This creature was originally one of the peach trees by my side.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_14":"But it was corrupted by the Abyss... taking on my appearance to deceive others.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_15":"How can we tell them apart when even their tone and emotions are identical?","dialogue_season4_10210_1_16":"Wukong's Golden Cudgel instantly glows, thrusting straight at Dahlia.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_17":"What a petty trick.","dialogue_season4_10210_1_18":"Impostor, reveal your true form!","dialogue_season4_10210_2_1":"Phew, that was close...","dialogue_season4_10210_2_2":"Dahlia, are you alright?","dialogue_season4_10210_2_3":"You seem a bit exhausted too.","dialogue_season4_10210_2_4":"That Peach Blossom Spirit was indeed quite troublesome, and we've used up quite a bit of energy.","dialogue_season4_10210_2_5":"Dahlia, could you lead us to rest for a moment?","dialogue_season4_10210_2_6":"Of course, but...","dialogue_season4_10210_2_7":"Dahlia gracefully wraps around Elune, her smile alluring.","dialogue_season4_10210_2_8":"It depends on whether you three have what it takes to leave my side.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_1":"Dahlia, you...!","dialogue_season4_10215_1_2":"Did you set us up?","dialogue_season4_10215_1_3":"Don't look so hurt. The praise I gave you was all sincere.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_4":"I truly thank you for helping me clear out those corrupted Peach Blossom Spirits.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_5":"Though if you hadn't come, I wouldn't have needed to release those little guys in the first place.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_6":"And they wouldn't have become corrupted.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_7":"Tsk, have we been deceived?","dialogue_season4_10215_1_8":"I don't trust outsiders, especially you, corrupted one.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_9":"The paradise is facing enough threats as it is.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_10":"Dahlia's words awaken the Omniguardian's memory, and both Elune and Wukong show signs of realization.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_11":"The paradise... That's right, Omniguardian. We're here to find the Relic!","dialogue_season4_10215_1_12":"Yes... I need to return to the Seraphic Court. We've already wasted too much time!","dialogue_season4_10215_1_13":"When you were indulging in the beauty of the Peach Blossom Paradise, you completely forgot your original purpose, didn't you?","dialogue_season4_10215_1_14":"In that case, why not stay here forever?","dialogue_season4_10215_1_15":"You'll regret standing in our way.","dialogue_season4_10215_1_16":"Don't be so sure. The previous battles must have left you quite exhausted, right?","dialogue_season4_10215_1_17":"But don't worry, I'll make it quick.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_1":"Dahlia is defeated, half-leaning against a peach tree, silently observing her opponents.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_2":"Hey, you lost.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_3":"What do you mean by \"lost\"? I've held you up for long enough.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_4":"How can the outcome be so easily defined when one has given their all?","dialogue_season4_10215_2_5":"You did what you did to protect the paradise.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_6":"The paradise... I have a dear friend in paradise. I can't leave her to face the enemy alone.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_7":"But we're not your enemy.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_8":"Elune walks up to Dahlia and extends her hand to her.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_9":"The Abyss is our common enemy.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_10":"...","dialogue_season4_10215_2_11":"Dahlia's gaze shifts between the three. She sighs lightly, wearing a bitter smile.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_12":"It seems I've misjudged the ones to test.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_13":"If you're going to apologize, you might want to be a bit more sincere.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_14":"Hehe, I should have realized it earlier.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_15":"Despite being misled by illusions and losing your original purpose, you were able to identify the peach blossom spirit at a glance.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_16":"This just goes to show that deep within you, there's something you're holding onto.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_17":"Perhaps you do have the determination to protect the paradise.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_18":"I won't let the Abyss run rampant before me.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_19":"Then I wish you a swift recovery of your strength, so you can protect the paradise from the Abyss.","dialogue_season4_10215_2_20":"If you really manage to achieve that, I'll make sure to repay you all.","dialogue_season4_10301_1_1":"Back at the celestial ladder, after the peach blossoms scatter, stairs leading upwards are revealed.","dialogue_season4_10301_1_2":"If you encounter my friend in the paradise, please give her my regards.","dialogue_season4_10301_1_3":"What's your friend's name?","dialogue_season4_10301_1_4":"You don't need to know her name. You'll understand what I mean when you meet her.","dialogue_season4_10301_1_5":"Dahlia turns towards the peach blossom grove, gradually obscured by strong winds and lightning, signaling imminent danger.","dialogue_season4_10301_1_6":"Be cautious, Omniguardian. More celestial beings have reappeared!","dialogue_season4_10301_2_1":"After shaking off the celestial beings, they come upon vast stretches of yellow sand, a solitary city, and atop its walls, a figure cloaked in fiery red.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_2":"Halt!","dialogue_season4_10301_2_3":"State your names!","dialogue_season4_10301_2_4":"Are you... Dahlia's friend?","dialogue_season4_10301_2_5":"Do you know Dahlia from the Peach Blossom Paradise?","dialogue_season4_10301_2_6":"I am Mulan, guardian of the paradise.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_7":"Who are you? And what brings you here?","dialogue_season4_10301_2_8":"The nine-tailed fox sends you her regards. Okay, enough chatter. Let us in.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_9":"Mulan's gaze falls upon Wukong, her expression shifting from uncertainty to determination in an instant.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_10":"I cannot allow you to pass, corrupted one.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_11":"What?","dialogue_season4_10301_2_12":"If Dahlia could let you in, then surely she's been convinced by you. But...","dialogue_season4_10301_2_13":"Mulan draws her sword, as the crimson dragon coiled around her shoulders opens its fierce ruby eyes.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_14":"When I stand upon these walls, I am no longer anyone's friend. I am the guardian of the Eastern paradise, the last Warrior Maiden.","dialogue_season4_10301_2_15":"Strangers, do not advance any further, else my dragon spirit will claim your lives.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_1":"Please go back. I have no intention of harming you.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_2":"Please also tell Dahlia not to worry too much about the safety of the Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_3":"Even if I'm the only one left to fight, I will never allow the Abyss to reach into the Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_4":"You're so stubborn!","dialogue_season4_10305_1_5":"But you don't need to fight alone.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_6":"If the person watching my back is you, then I can fight with great peace of mind.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_7":"Your eyes tell me you're not a bad person.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_8":"What's that supposed to mean?","dialogue_season4_10305_1_9":"Corrupted one, you know exactly what I mean.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_10":"You can't control your own power. Even your consciousness can easily be manipulated by the Abyss.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_11":"That's why he needs to enter the Seraphic Court, to cleanse his demonic nature.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_12":"But it can't be now.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_13":"My choice not only concerns myself, but also the fate of the Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_14":"I can't take such a big risk and leave my back to a corrupted one.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_15":"You...!","dialogue_season4_10305_1_16":"Why do you want to enter the Seraphic Court so badly, even if it means opposing me?","dialogue_season4_10305_1_17":"Have you lost something important?","dialogue_season4_10305_1_18":"Of course I have. But the most important thing to me right now is my duty, the place I must protect.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_19":"...","dialogue_season4_10305_1_20":"Very well.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_21":"You know what you have to do. That's good.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_22":"You...","dialogue_season4_10305_1_23":"Now, I also have to reclaim what's important to me.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_24":"Move aside!","dialogue_season4_10305_1_25":"Mulan, we have been side by side with Wukong all this way.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_26":"We believe that he is determined to reconcile with his past and find himself, all for the sake of protecting the paradise.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_27":"Naive. But I respect your decision.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_28":"If you can fight me with a clear mind.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_29":"Then I believe you're worthy of me entrusting my back to you.","dialogue_season4_10305_1_30":"Let's find out!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_1":"Your reaction is too slow. Besides, only defending won't break my moves! Are you afraid of losing control of the evil within you?!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_2":"The intense battle causes the suppressed demonic nature within Wukong to resurface, making his movements slightly sluggish.","dialogue_season4_10305_2_3":"Um... Omniguardian, the seal is loosening again!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_4":"I see. He has managed to hold on this long thanks to your help.","dialogue_season4_10305_2_5":"We just provided a little help.","dialogue_season4_10305_2_6":"No, I won't lose...","dialogue_season4_10305_2_7":"I won't let evil take over my body!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_8":"I can feel that you're trying hard to suppress your demonic nature.","dialogue_season4_10305_2_9":"But you should know, this bit of self-control is useless against the Abyss!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_10":"Before she finishes speaking, Mulan's attacks become faster and fiercer, each strike nearly fatal to Wukong.","dialogue_season4_10305_2_11":"Damn you, crazy woman!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_12":"If you can still talk, it means your resolve isn't firm enough!","dialogue_season4_10305_2_13":"...Again!","dialogue_season4_10310_1_1":"Not enough. Far from enough.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_2":"Letting someone with a wavering heart into the Seraphic Court will only cost us our lives in the battle against the Abyss.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_3":"Give up. Turning back now will be much easier.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_4":"Stop talking nonsense... I haven't even used half my strength!","dialogue_season4_10310_1_5":"The continuous fighting has clearly pushed Wukong, who is desperately suppressing his demonic nature, to the limit.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_6":"Yet, he stubbornly grips his Golden Cudgel, his eyes burning with fierce determination.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_7":"Again!","dialogue_season4_10310_1_8":"...Hah, not bad.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_9":"You are a worthy opponent. I should show my sincerity as well.","dialogue_season4_10310_1_10":"Next comes the life-or-death duel!","dialogue_season4_10310_1_11":"Ha, now this is what I'm talking about!","dialogue_season4_10310_2_1":"The Golden Cudgel falls to the ground. Wukong clutches his head with both hands, a gut-wrenching roar escaping his throat.","dialogue_season4_10310_2_2":"Have you given up?","dialogue_season4_10310_2_3":"...Die...","dialogue_season4_10310_2_4":"Omniguardian, something's wrong...","dialogue_season4_10310_2_5":"...Die... ...Die...","dialogue_season4_10310_2_6":"Wukong suddenly lifts his head, his eyes blood-red, his expression terrifying like a demon.","dialogue_season4_10310_2_7":"Get out of my way!!","dialogue_season4_10315_1_1":"Everyone get out of my way!!","dialogue_season4_10315_1_2":"Roaring, Wukong vents his fury at Mulan, looking no different from those corrupted monsters.","dialogue_season4_10315_1_3":"He's completely lost control. Mulan, be careful!","dialogue_season4_10315_1_4":"The Golden Cudgel spins in Wukong's hands, his movements now aggressive and unrestrained, unlike his earlier hesitant state.","dialogue_season4_10315_1_5":"This immense power! This feeling of freedom and unrestrained liberty! It's incredible!","dialogue_season4_10315_1_6":"In the end, you can't overcome yourself, can you?","dialogue_season4_10315_1_7":"I am who I am. Why should I overcome myself?","dialogue_season4_10315_1_8":"With this power, nothing can stop me!","dialogue_season4_10315_1_9":"Although it's unfortunate, at least die while you still have a shred of humanity left.","dialogue_season4_10315_1_10":"Do you want to fight me? Go ahead and try!","dialogue_season4_10315_1_11":"None of you will leave here alive!","dialogue_season4_10315_2_1":"The corrupted Wukong and Mulan fight fiercely, the former's manic laughter sending shivers down everyone's spine.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_2":"Although Mulan seems evenly matched, she appears somewhat restrained.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_3":"She has concerns.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_4":"What's the matter? Weren't you so confident just now? Are you afraid?","dialogue_season4_10315_2_5":"Are you afraid I'll destroy the Seraphic Court you protect?","dialogue_season4_10315_2_6":"Almost instantly, Wukong leaps, his Golden Cudgel carrying a murderous intent aimed at the lonely city behind Mulan!","dialogue_season4_10315_2_7":"Stop!!","dialogue_season4_10315_2_8":"Hahaha, what's there to defend in a crumbling city?","dialogue_season4_10315_2_9":"...!!!","dialogue_season4_10315_2_10":"Wukong keenly senses something amiss, his movements suddenly faltering.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_11":"Is there... someone inside the city?","dialogue_season4_10315_2_12":"Mulan exerts her last ounce of strength to withstand Wukong's assault.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_13":"I... I can't control... myself...","dialogue_season4_10315_2_14":"Don't do something you'll regret!","dialogue_season4_10315_2_15":"Aaaahhh!","dialogue_season4_10315_2_16":"After Wukong's roar, the Abyss's influence entwining him dissipates completely.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_17":"He collapses, too weak to even lift his head to see the outcome.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_18":"Hey...","dialogue_season4_10315_2_19":"Tell me.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_20":"I didn't... mess up, did I?","dialogue_season4_10315_2_21":"...","dialogue_season4_10315_2_22":"You're not my enemy anymore.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_23":"That's not an empty city; it's the last gathering place of the Seraphic Court in the paradise.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_24":"Many powerless, ordinary people live there.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_25":"Mulan helps the weakened Wukong up, both turning towards the unscathed Seraphic Court.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_26":"You did it. You overcame yourself.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_27":"Even when corrupted, you still care for the people.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_28":"In the face of the Abyss threatening the paradise, I'm willing to entrust my back to such a companion.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_29":"What about you?","dialogue_season4_10315_2_30":"...","dialogue_season4_10315_2_31":"Ha, consider this a ceasefire.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_32":"Mulan smiles with relief.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_33":"Go ahead. The gate of the Seraphic Court will open for you.","dialogue_season4_10315_2_34":"I'll entrust my back to you as well.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_1":"This is strange...","dialogue_season4_10401_1_2":"What's wrong?","dialogue_season4_10401_1_3":"Omniguardian, I feel... the Relic isn't here.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_4":"And...","dialogue_season4_10401_1_5":"Since just now, I've felt like the Relic is somehow near me.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_6":"It's around us... not inside the city.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_7":"It's either here or it's not. Why complicate things?","dialogue_season4_10401_1_8":"Wukong, have your memories returned?","dialogue_season4_10401_1_9":"Tsk, I'm completely clueless.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_10":"As everyone ponders, they suddenly hear a familiar, crisp call from a distance.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_11":"Hurry up and open the gate!","dialogue_season4_10401_1_12":"How did that little fox get here?","dialogue_season4_10401_1_13":"Wait, that's...","dialogue_season4_10401_1_14":"Everyone looks towards the desert, where they see several monsters appearing in the sky, while Mulan leads Dahlia in a retreat.","dialogue_season4_10401_1_15":"Watch your backs! The celestial beings influenced by the Abyss are coming!","dialogue_season4_10401_1_16":"Get ready to fight!","dialogue_season4_10401_2_1":"Hey everyone, it's been a few days. Did you miss me?","dialogue_season4_10401_2_2":"Dahlia, what brings you here?","dialogue_season4_10401_2_3":"It's a long story...","dialogue_season4_10401_2_4":"Dahlia, time is short, so get to the point.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_5":"Alright, alright, no need to rush.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_6":"In short... the Abyss is here!","dialogue_season4_10401_2_7":"The Peach Blossom Paradise has been destroyed, so I fled for my life.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_8":"Thankfully, Mulan came to my aid just in time, or else I would've been torn apart by those dreadful monsters.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_9":"Wait, I sense trouble.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_10":"The wind's aura has changed.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_11":"Before the words finish, the wind and clouds shift dramatically, a massive shadow accompanied by immense pressure forces almost everyone to their knees.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_12":"Only the Omniguardian remains standing tall, locking eyes with the impending presence.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_13":"This is...","dialogue_season4_10401_2_14":"Wukong gazes at the gradually forming colossal creature in the distance, a name slipping from his lips without hesitation.","dialogue_season4_10401_2_15":"Abyssal Deity!","dialogue_season4_10405_1_1":"At the moment of seeing the Abyssal Deity, the evil thoughts begin to erode Wukong's sanity once again.","dialogue_season4_10405_1_2":"Damn it! There's a force calling me to the Abyssal Deity...","dialogue_season4_10405_1_3":"Well, well, well, look who's still alive.","dialogue_season4_10405_1_4":"Seems like the monsters inside you aren't strong enough yet, not able to fully take over your body.","dialogue_season4_10405_1_5":"What... What are you saying?","dialogue_season4_10405_1_6":"Hehe, judging by your puzzled look, you haven't regained your memories, have you?","dialogue_season4_10405_1_7":"Even luck is on my side!","dialogue_season4_10405_1_8":"It's going to launch an attack. Everyone be careful!","dialogue_season4_10405_1_9":"Beg for mercy under my Abyssal flames!","dialogue_season4_10405_1_10":"I will crown myself with your corpse and become the new ruler of this world!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_1":"The power of the Abyssal Deity is extraordinary. In just moments, everyone's energy is almost completely depleted.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_2":"Ugh... cough!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_3":"Wukong withstands a heavy blow from the Abyssal Deity, painfully coughing up blood as he crashes into the yellow sand.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_4":"Wukong's down! This isn't working. The enemy is too strong for us to keep this up.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_5":"I'm afraid the enemy won't give us a chance!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_6":"On the other side, Elune and the Omniguardian are also locked in a bitter battle.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_7":"Omniguardian, without the Relic's blessing, we can't unleash our full power in battle!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_8":"Exorcism Cauldron, please respond to my call...","dialogue_season4_10405_2_9":"Are we going to die here?","dialogue_season4_10405_2_10":"Now, bow down to me and I'll give you a chance to make amends.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_11":"Hmph, wishful thinking!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_12":"Then we'll have to do this the hard way!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_13":"The Abyssal Deity opens its monstrous mouth, black flames engulfing countless souls' cries, rushing towards everyone.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_14":"Aaaaah! Begone!","dialogue_season4_10405_2_15":"That familiar, exhausted figure appears before everyone, single-handedly resisting the surging black flames.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_16":"Heh, you're still alive.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_17":"Those who wish for my demise probably line up from the Seraphic Court to the bamboo forest.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_18":"Sparks seem to emanate from Wukong's chest, like hardened steel just forged in fire.","dialogue_season4_10405_2_19":"But I'm not about to grant your wish!","dialogue_season4_10410_1_1":"Wukong's strength has returned to its peak. He gazes at his hands with a different expression from before.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_2":"Have you remembered something?","dialogue_season4_10410_1_3":"Yeah, I've regained my memories.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_4":"Turns out your Exorcism Cauldron was hidden in my chest.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_5":"What do you mean?!","dialogue_season4_10410_1_6":"During the last Abyss invasion, I borrowed the power of the Exorcism Cauldron to fight against the invading monsters.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_7":"However, outnumbered and to prevent further devastation, I had to forcefully activate the Relic, devouring those Abyss monsters.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_8":"And then... I sealed the Relic containing those monsters within my consciousness.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_9":"So... you lost your memories because you were protecting the world...","dialogue_season4_10410_1_10":"Now, it's time to return the Relic to its rightful owner.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_11":"To save the paradise and everyone living here, please take back the Exorcism Cauldron, and defeat the Abyssal Deity once and for all!","dialogue_season4_10410_1_12":"Not on my watch!","dialogue_season4_10410_1_13":"The Abyssal Deity roars, and countless monsters surge towards everyone.","dialogue_season4_10410_1_14":"No one can defeat me! Not even you, the former Sky Destroyer!","dialogue_season4_10410_1_15":"You've picked the wrong opponent, I'm afraid.","dialogue_season4_10410_2_1":"That loach is going all out against us. Now's our chance!","dialogue_season4_10410_2_2":"Exorcism Cauldron, respond to my call!","dialogue_season4_10410_2_3":"I need your power; this world needs your protection!","dialogue_season4_10410_2_4":"Golden light seeps out from Wukong's body. At Elune's call, a magnificent golden-red cauldron emerges from him.","dialogue_season4_10415_1_1":"Heh, now that this thing is out, I feel so much lighter.","dialogue_season4_10415_1_2":"The reason you were corrupted earlier was likely due to the influence of the sealed monsters within the cauldron.","dialogue_season4_10415_1_3":"But now...","dialogue_season4_10415_1_4":"Elune easily purifies the Exorcism Cauldron, which was nearly corrupted by the monsters.","dialogue_season4_10415_1_5":"The Exorcism Cauldron has returned to its peak power.","dialogue_season4_10415_1_6":"How is this possible?!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_7":"What's the matter? Are you scared?","dialogue_season4_10415_1_8":"No! It's not over yet... You're just struggling in vain...","dialogue_season4_10415_1_9":"Even if you've regained your memories, so what? You're still no match for the Abyss!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_10":"I will become the strongest! I will never... I will never go back to who I was!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_11":"Abyss, lend me more power!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_12":"I will achieve greatness! Aaaaah!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_13":"He's going berserk. His power might rise to another level!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_14":"Omniguardian, the Exorcism Cauldron is ready for battle at any time!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_15":"Let's shatter the Abyssal Deity's delusions!","dialogue_season4_10415_1_16":"Come on, my flames can no longer be contained!","dialogue_season4_10415_2_1":"How is this possible... The Abyss... The Abyss cannot be defeated...","dialogue_season4_10415_2_2":"That power just now... A you the \"Omniguardian\" that the Lord mentioned?","dialogue_season4_10415_2_3":"Before the Abyssal Deity can finish speaking, the Abyss aura surrounding him suddenly dissipates completely.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_4":"The large black dragon immediately transforms into a small loach, desperately tumbling down the celestial ladder.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_5":"...","dialogue_season4_10415_2_6":"Huh? So that guy really was a loach?","dialogue_season4_10415_2_7":"With the Abyssal Deity defeated, the rift in the paradise caused by the Abyss is sealed.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_8":"Thanks to you, the paradise is saved from destruction.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_9":"We are forever grateful for your help.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_10":"If you ever need anything, feel free to call me.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_11":"This is the result of everyone's efforts.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_12":"You are truly humble.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_13":"Omniguardian, now that we have retrieved the Relic, should we prepare to return?","dialogue_season4_10415_2_14":"If possible, please take me with you as well.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_15":"I feel that, by staying with you, I've discovered a deeper meaning in martial arts.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_16":"Mulan gazes at the Omniguardian with a serious expression.","dialogue_season4_10415_2_17":"That meaning is... compassion for all beings.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_1":"Hey, by the way...","dialogue_season4_10501_1_2":"Aren't you a Divine, Wukong? Why do you still look like a Demon?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_3":"You think I want to look like this?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_4":"If my consciousness hadn't been disturbed by the Abyss for so long, I wouldn't have to stay in this demonized form.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_5":"But it doesn't matter what I look like.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_6":"As long as my heart remains unchanged, I'm still myself.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_7":"Just think of it as my badge of honor.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_8":"Badge of honor... Only the handsome and dashing Omniguardian is worthy of it.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_9":"Eh? Oh no, did Omniguardian hear my inner thoughts?!","dialogue_season4_10501_1_10":"Still, you came at the right time. Would you like to take a walk with me?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_11":"Talking and laughing, Dahlia leads the Omniguardian back to the grove, where the peach blossoms remain as beautiful as ever.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_12":"The damage the Abyss did to the paradise will be carefully repaired, just like this peach blossom grove.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_13":"That's great.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_14":"Aha, I knew you would say that.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_15":"Omniguardian, would you like to explore the depths of Peach Blossom Paradise with me?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_16":"I promise I won't tempt you to forget yourself this time.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_17":"Dahlia leans close to the Omniguardian again, her enchanting fox tail curling enticingly.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_18":"My secret base is there. Only you are allowed to see it…","dialogue_season4_10501_1_19":"Alright.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_20":"So, what do you think? It's a nice place, right?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_21":"Deep in the Peach Blossom Paradise stands an elegant little cottage, with a view of dazzling pink blossoms through the flower-patterned windows.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_22":"It's truly beautiful. No matter how many times I see this scenery, I never tire of it.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_23":"Just thinking about almost losing this beautiful view makes my chest ache…","dialogue_season4_10501_1_24":"So… I should get to the point.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_25":"Omniguardian, aren't you curious about how the Abyss is found here?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_26":"Who was it that led the Abyss to endanger this paradise?","dialogue_season4_10501_1_27":"I happened to stumble upon the reason while I was out…","dialogue_season4_10501_1_28":"In Dahlia's enchanting golden eyes, the Omniguardian's reflection is clear.","dialogue_season4_10501_1_29":"The one behind it all has a face just like yours.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_1":"Aiushtha waited at the gates of Mirlond, watching as Nyx and Nawi slowly walked in. She observed them for a moment and noticed a hint of exhaustion in their eyes.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_2":"Welcome back, you both must be tired.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_3":"The abyssal creatures at the empire's border have been eradicated. They won't be launching any attacks in the future.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_4":"Shh, no need to report this to me. I'm just here under orders to welcome you back.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_5":"Is it from the Omniguardian?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_6":"It's obvious. Who else but the Omniguardian could command her?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_7":"What are the Omniguardian's orders?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_8":"Come with me.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_9":"...So mysterious.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_10":"Under Aiushtha's guidance,\nthe three of them arrived before the Omniguardian.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_11":"Omniguardian, I brought them. Please, keep your promise to me.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_12":"I will.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_13":"Omniguardian, what are your orders?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_14":"The Omniguardian didn't respond but handed her an envelope labeled \"Zephyr Fest Invitation.\"","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_15":"Zephyr Fest Invitation?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_16":"I've heard of it. The Zephyr Fest is a tradition in Zephyr Town, drawing large crowds every year... Have the abyssal creatures targeted them?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_17":"No need to worry.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_18":"The Omniguardian has been planning this for a while. You've all been running around for months, tense and worn out. It's time to relax a bit.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_19":"Are you taking us... on a vacation?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_20":"But I just heard there are abyssal creatures in the dark forest...","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_21":"Marina has already taken a team there.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_22":"So the promise the Omniguardian made to you was to bring you along?","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_23":"Of course, how could we go on a trip without me? Besides, the Omniguardian is quite fond of my swimsuit.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_24":"...Boring.","dialogue_summer2_10001_1_25":"Anyway, just enjoy the vacation the Omniguardian arranged for you.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_1":"Zephyr Town... The last time we were here, it was a battlefield.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_2":"Seeing this vibrant town now shows that our efforts weren't in vain. Maybe a holiday isn't such a bad idea.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_3":"The sea breeze does make me feel a bit more relaxed. Is that why you brought us here?","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_4":"Don't overthink it. Just rest.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_5":"You're right! Since we're here, let's unwind!","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_6":"But it seems there's some excitement already.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_7":"What's going on over there...","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_8":"Only those with an invitation can enter the town during the Zephyr Fest.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_9":"What if I insist on going in? Get out of my way!","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_10":"Ugh!","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_11":"Looks like the guards are having trouble.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_12":"Indeed, there's always someone like this. Since we're here, let's deal with it.","dialogue_summer2_10101_1_13":"Hey, some nosy guys have shown up!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_1":"Fine, just you wait!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_2":"Parlok, you're not welcome here!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_3":"You won't hold your position for long. Just wait, I'll be the mayor of Zephyr Town one day!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_4":"Parlok turned and walked away. The mayor watched him go, sighed, and then turned to Nyx, extending a hand.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_5":"Welcome to Zephyr Town! I'm the mayor. It's an honor to have guests from Mirlond.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_6":"Hello, Mayor. You know us?","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_7":"We've heard your story. In Zephyr Town, everyone knows it's you who brought peace and tranquility to this land.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_8":"That's why, at the insistence of the townspeople, I sent you the invitation.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_9":"During this Zephyr Fest, we hope every guest can let go of their burdens and enjoy this peace and joy.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_10":"Who was that just now?","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_11":"Old history, let's not dwell on it.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_12":"Right, let's talk about the Zephyr Fest!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_13":"It's our annual celebration, to give thanks for the blessings bestowed upon us by the sea breeze waves.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_14":"If I may, please allow me to invite you all to join our festivities.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_15":"Sounds appealing, but we...","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_16":"We'll join.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_17":"...Omniguardian!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_18":"Sometimes, relaxing is key to facing challenges better, isn't it?","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_19":"You're right. We accept your invitation to participate in the Zephyr Fest.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_20":"...Nawi, even you... Alright, count me in too.","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_21":"That's truly an honor. Go on, enjoy the waves, the sunshine, and the Zephyr Fest of this summer!","dialogue_summer2_10101_2_22":"But before that, we need to change into outfits suitable for the festival.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_1":"In the coastal waters of Zephyr Town, sunlight danced on the sparkling sea surface as Nyx and Nawi rode a small boat towards a group of playful creatures frolicking in the shallow waters.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_2":"The first activity is collecting shells... It's been so many years since I've done something like this.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_3":"But collecting from creatures is indeed rare. Are these creatures really not dangerous?","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_4":"They seem to be playing; they don't appear dangerous. But still, we should be cautious, after all, they are creatures.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_5":"As the boat approached, a group of colorful creatures swam in the water, their backs adorned with shimmering zephyr shells.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_6":"We need to approach gently, so as not to startle them.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_7":"It's too late; they've already started to flee.","dialogue_summer2_10105_1_8":"Since it's a game, it won't be that simple. Let's get to it, make sure they don't escape.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_1":"As the collection progressed, the basket gradually filled with zephyr shells.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_2":"These shells are truly special; they seem to contain some sort of magic.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_3":"Yes, I can feel their power. The mayor mentioned that these shells are important for the celebration.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_4":"We collected so many with ease; perhaps we should consider offering a shell collection service here in the future.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_5":"We can collect some more.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_6":"You're right. It's up to you now.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_7":"And you?","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_8":"I feel like taking it easy. Sunbathing sounds pretty good.","dialogue_summer2_10105_2_9":"...I wish I could trap you inside my mirror.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_1":"As they collected more and more, some larger and darker-colored creatures began to approach them, their eyes gleaming with unfriendly glints.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_2":"Looks like we've caught the attention of some big guys.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_3":"Yes, they don't seem welcoming.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_4":"Several larger creatures started circling the small boat, their movements swift and powerful, creating ripples upon ripples in the water.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_5":"Looks like we need to handle this with care; these creatures might not let us leave easily.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_6":"Are you ready? We might need a little skirmish.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_7":"As Nawi's words trailed off, a large creature suddenly leaped out of the water, launching an attack on the small boat.","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_8":"Come on, let's see what you're made of!","dialogue_summer2_10110_1_9":"Let's go, Nyx!","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_1":"The two displayed a seamless cooperation, easily countering the creature's attacks. Their weapons gleamed in the sunlight, each strike precise and accurate.","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_2":"Looks like these big guys aren't much of a challenge.","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_3":"Perhaps they were just attracted by our shells.","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_4":"As the battle progressed, the creatures gradually realized they were no match and began to retreat.","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_5":"Looks like they're giving up.","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_6":"Maybe these domesticated creatures were just a small test for the shell activity.","dialogue_summer2_10110_2_7":"Yes, it seems safe for us to return now.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_1":"Nyx and Nawi successfully returned to the pier of Zephyr Town, presenting the collected zephyr shells to the town's elders and residents. The twilight cast its glow upon the shells, emitting a soft and mysterious light.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_2":"Mayor, besides being part of the celebration, do these zephyr shells have any other special significance?","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_3":"Ah, these shells are not just decorations; they also hold the power of the sea breeze. During the Zephyr Fest, they bring us luck and protection.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_4":"Protection? What does that mean?","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_5":"During the festivities of the Zephyr Fest, these shells are used to decorate our ships and homes. Their magic protects us from the storms at sea.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_6":"With the mayor's explanation, some residents began to hang shells on their doors and windows or decorate their boats' railings.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_7":"So, they're like talismans? Interesting.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_8":"Not only that, but the zephyr shells also symbolize unity and sharing. At the end of the celebration, we will cast some of the shells back into the sea as a gesture of gratitude to the sea breeze and respect for life.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_9":"Nyx and Nawi helped hang some shells on the lamp posts at the pier, the shells shimmering with a warm glow under the setting sun.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_10":"Nawi, seeing these shells, I feel a calm power.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_11":"Yes, perhaps that's why the residents of Zephyr Town are so fond of the Zephyr Fest.","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_12":"Now that you're back, I'd like to invite you to be participants in the opening battle of the Zephyr Fest. What do you think?","dialogue_summer2_10115_1_13":"I'd be honored.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_1":"This opening battle was a perfect conclusion. The mayor stepped forward onto the stage, addressing the bustling crowd below.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_2":"What a thrilling battle! Just in time for the opening of the Zephyr Fest!","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_3":"So, with that, I declare the Zephyr Fest officially open!","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_4":"May the power of the sea breeze accompany our laughter, and our dances, and reach far, far away!","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_5":"As night fell, the festivities in Zephyr Town gradually began. The town band started playing lively music, and the residents danced around the bonfire.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_6":"This is truly a beautiful and meaningful tradition.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_7":"This is probably why everyone is so eager for festivals.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_8":"How do you feel?","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_9":"Thank you, Omniguardian, I think I understand your intentions now.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_10":"Oh? Care to share?","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_11":"I won't tell you.","dialogue_summer2_10115_2_12":"Hmph.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_1":"At the dawn of the pier in Zephyr Town, sunlight filtered through thin clouds, seagulls circled overhead. Nyx and Nawi stood on a boat adorned with zephyr shells, ready to set sail for the mysterious Zephyr Island.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_2":"Zephyr Island is said to be the sacred land of Zephyr Town. What kind of adventures await us there?","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_3":"According to the mayor, the zephyr shells we collected will also be our aid.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_4":"Zephyr shells are indeed very useful, but their wonders need to be discovered slowly during our journey.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_5":"This is the map to Zephyr Island. Though it's ancient, it will guide you to the right course.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_6":"But you need to be cautious; annoying creatures often appear at sea. Don't stray from the course because of them.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_7":"After you arrive at Zephyr Island, remember to retrieve the treasures of the Zephyr Fest.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_8":"Thank you, Mayor.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_9":"Zephyr Island is our town's pride and a place to test courage and wisdom. May the sea breeze bless you.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_10":"So, let's set off, Nyx. Let our ship ride the waves and head straight to Zephyr Island.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_11":"With Nawi's command, the boat slowly left the pier, heading towards Zephyr Island. The zephyr shells shimmered in the sunlight, seemingly blessing their journey.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_12":"The sea breeze seems to be guiding us.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_13":"The markings on the map are clear. Let's set sail.","dialogue_summer2_10201_1_14":"The ship cuts through the waves as we leave the Zephyr Town behind.","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_1":"The open sea isn't really a place for fighting.","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_2":"But there's something else I'm worried about.","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_3":"What's that?","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_4":"Where are we now?","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_5":"I can't see the outline of Zephyr Island anymore!","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_6":"…That can't be right, we just left…","dialogue_summer2_10201_2_7":"Calm down and think carefully about our course so far.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_1":"The ship sails slowly across the blue waters, heading towards an island not far away.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_2":"Nawi, do you feel that? Something unusual is happening underwater.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_3":"It's sea beasts. They seem to be approaching us.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_4":"Suddenly, the water surface erupts as a huge sea beast emerges, its scales glistening in the sunlight, eyes scrutinizing us.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_5":"Let's head to shore first. It's hard to fight effectively on the water.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_6":"The map the mayor gave us says the sea beasts are the Omniguardians of the Zephyr Archipelago. They test every traveler who approaches the islands.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_7":"Are there sea beasts guarding places other than Zephyr Island? I thought only Zephyr Island had them, especially since we went off-course.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_8":"Regardless, we need to show our strength now.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_9":"With a soft thud, the ship reached the shore. The Omniguardians led Nyx and the others off the boat, ready to face the sea beasts' challenge.","dialogue_summer2_10205_1_10":"Perfect timing, I haven't had a good workout in a while.","dialogue_summer2_10205_2_1":"The sea beast let out a long roar before diving back into the water, leaving the surface calm again.","dialogue_summer2_10205_2_2":"Looks like it acknowledges us.","dialogue_summer2_10205_2_3":"Yes, the hostility in its eyes is gone.","dialogue_summer2_10205_2_4":"The sea beast slowly submerged, its tail gently slapping the water, creating a beautiful rainbow with the spray.","dialogue_summer2_10205_2_5":"It seems to be signaling us to follow.","dialogue_summer2_10205_2_6":"I think so too. Looks like we've passed the test and can safely head to Zephyr Island now.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_1":"Suddenly, a thick fog rose from the sea, quickly enveloping the entire area and obscuring everyone's vision.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_2":"This fog couldn't have come at a worse time. We need to navigate carefully to avoid going off-course.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_3":"The leading sea beast has disappeared too. Do you think... it could be a trap?","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_4":"Probably not. The map also mentions that there would be fog near Zephyr Island.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_5":"Besides, the compass isn't working. This fog seems to have some magical properties. We need to find another way to determine our direction.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_6":"As the fog thickened, navigating the ship became extremely difficult, and it began to drift in circles on the water.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_7":"Is this another test?","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_8":"The map mentions specific ocean currents around Zephyr Island that we should be able to use to navigate.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_9":"I can feel the wind's direction; it seems to be guiding us. If we follow the wind, we should find the right course.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_10":"Nawi guided Nyx in adjusting the sail's direction, and the ship started to slowly move with the wind.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_11":"You're right, the wind will lead us to the right place.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_12":"Look, the fog is beginning to clear! We've found the course.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_13":"As the ship followed the currents and wind, the dense fog gradually lifted, revealing the outline of Zephyr Island once again. The sea beast reappeared in front of the ship.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_14":"Zephyr Island is just ahead.","dialogue_summer2_10210_1_15":"There are some small monsters at the landing site. Let me clear a space for us to dock.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_1":"The ship smoothly navigated through the fog, and the beach and jungle of Zephyr Island looked particularly enchanting in the sunlight. The sea beast's tail splashed the water, creating waves as it disappeared into the surf.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_2":"The sea beast has left too.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_3":"Finally, we're here at Zephyr Island.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_4":"Well, the Zephyr Fest lasts for five days, and today is only the second day.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_5":"We have plenty of time to search for the treasure.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_6":"Now begins our treasure hunt.","dialogue_summer2_10210_2_7":"But first, we need to set up a place to rest.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_1":"On Zephyr Island, Nyx and Nawi chose a clear spot to set up a temporary camp. The area was surrounded by dense forest, with the sound of waves crashing in the distance.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_2":"This spot has a good view, perfect for setting up camp. We can start our exploration from here.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_3":"Yes, we need a secure base. Let's set up the tents first.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_4":"They began setting up the tents and camp facilities in an orderly manner.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_5":"We must ensure the camp's safety. Who knows what unknown dangers lurk on the island.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_6":"I've set up some alert spells around. If anything approaches, we'll know right away.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_7":"Suddenly, the ground shook, and a few wild creatures from the island were attracted to the commotion at the camp.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_8":"Your alert spells worked quickly.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_9":"Let's welcome our guests.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_10":"Or maybe we're the guests here.","dialogue_summer2_10215_1_11":"Doesn't matter, we need to deal with them. Or do you all want to sleep on the beach tonight?","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_1":"Using their combat skills and teamwork, they successfully repelled the creatures.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_2":"Looks like we're safe. These might just be ordinary creatures of the island, drawn by our activity.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_3":"The camp is intact. We can continue with our plans.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_4":"They continued to fortify the camp, ensuring safety for the night.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_5":"This should be enough. We can rest well tonight and prepare for tomorrow's exploration.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_6":"Rest up. I'm curious about what the zephyr treasure really is. Aren't you, Aiushtha?","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_7":"Aiushtha remained silent, seemingly deep in thought.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_8":"Aiushtha? What's on your mind?","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_9":"I have a feeling someone's been following us.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_10":"There are plenty of people here for the Zephyr Fest; maybe some are just headed in the same direction.","dialogue_summer2_10215_2_11":"Maybe.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_1":"After a night's rest, Nyx and Nawi woke up in their temporary camp on Zephyr Island.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_2":"What should we do first today?","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_3":"Find the zephyr spirit, right?","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_4":"Yes, the mayor said the treasure is guarded by the zephyr spirit.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_5":"I'm ready. But the spirit might not let us get close so easily.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_6":"According to the map and the mayor's information, the spirit should be in the island's center.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_7":"I can sense a strong magical presence to the south. That should be the center you mentioned.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_8":"Following Aiushtha's sensing of the magical presence, they moved forward, crossing dense forests and streams until they reached an open grassy area.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_9":"Be careful, the zephyr spirit might be nearby.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_10":"I'm ready. No matter how powerful the spirit is, we won't back down.","dialogue_summer2_10301_1_11":"Suddenly, a giant zephyr spirit rose from the grass, its eyes gleaming with wisdom and its body radiating powerful magic.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_1":"We are emissaries from Zephyr Town, here to find the treasure needed for the festival. We mean no harm.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_2":"These shells are our tokens, proving we were invited.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_3":"The magical energy from the zephyr shells began to flow, and after scrutinizing the two for a moment, the zephyr spirit slowly nodded, acknowledging their identity.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_4":"As is customary, you must pass my trial.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_5":"Can we really communicate through our minds?","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_6":"I understand now. The zephyr shells are not just symbols of the town, but also a bridge to communicate with the zephyr spirit.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_7":"So that's the special use the mayor mentioned... Please tell us, what is the trial?","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_8":"We're ready to face any challenge.","dialogue_summer2_10301_2_9":"The zephyr spirit stepped back, clearing a space for the trial to begin.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_1":"Nyx and Nawi stood before the zephyr spirit, ready to prove themselves.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_2":"The spirit let out a long howl, causing the ground to shake, and a giant stone golem rose from the earth.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_3":"This trial is to defeat that creature?","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_4":"It looks like a magical construct, very sturdy.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_5":"This seems to be a test of strength. We need to be careful.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_6":"I'm ready. Let's show the zephyr spirit our power.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_7":"The stone golem attacked them, its movements slow but powerful. Each strike carried immense force.","dialogue_summer2_10305_1_8":"Its weak points are at the joints. We need to find opportunities to strike.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_1":"After an intense battle, Nyx and Nawi, with their coordinated efforts and excellent combat skills, managed to defeat the stone golem.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_2":"This test of strength didn't defeat us.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_3":"Zephyr spirit, have we passed the trial?","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_4":"The zephyr spirit approached, communicating with them through mind connection, eyes showing approval.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_5":"You have demonstrated remarkable strength and courage. You have passed this trial.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_6":"A light emitted from the zephyr spirit slowly landed in Nyx's palm.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_7":"What is this?","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_8":"This is a fragment of my power and the treasure you seek. It represents the wind.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_9":"Oh, I thought it would be some kind of gold or jewels...","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_10":"The people of Zephyr Town value spiritual wealth over material riches. That's why I choose to protect them.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_11":"I understand. Thank you for the trial.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_12":"Though we don't know what the next trial will be, we're ready.","dialogue_summer2_10305_2_13":"The zephyr spirit let out a soft hum, causing the stone golem to crumble. The surroundings gradually returned to tranquility, and everyone prepared for the next phase of the trials.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_1":"Guided by the zephyr spirit, Nyx and Nawi arrived at a wide beach on Zephyr Island. An ancient stone instrument array stood on the beach, producing melodious sounds whenever the waves crashed against the shore.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_2":"These instruments seem linked to the rhythm of the waves. We need to find a way to harmonize with the ocean's melody.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_3":"The rhythm of the waves is key. We need to adjust the instruments to create the correct tune.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_4":"The zephyr spirit stood at one end of the beach, quietly watching them, waiting for them to solve this ocean-related puzzle.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_5":"The ocean is the source of life, and the breeze is its breath. Only by syncing with the rhythm of the waves can you hear the final call.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_6":"Let's start with this stone drum. Its deep sound seems to resonate with the low hum of the waves.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_7":"I'll adjust the other instruments to match the wave's rhythm. We need to find the right melody.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_8":"Following the rhythm of the waves, they began adjusting the instruments, but their initial attempts were unsuccessful, producing chaotic sounds.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_9":"We need to observe the wave patterns more closely. Each wave has a unique rhythm.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_10":"I'll record the wave rhythms, and then we can try adjusting the instruments again.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_11":"They focused on observing and recording the wave rhythms and then adjusted the instruments accordingly. With their efforts, the instruments began to produce harmonious melodies.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_12":"It's still not quite right. Something feels off.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_13":"It might be those little creatures.","dialogue_summer2_10310_1_14":"Monsters? Are they drawn by the melody of the waves? I'll drive them away.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_1":"After driving away the creatures, they adjusted the instruments again.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_2":"The discordant tones finally disappeared.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_3":"Let's finish this wave melody.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_4":"Accompanied by the sea breeze, they gradually found a method to harmonize the melody with the wave rhythm. Their efforts led to the perfect fusion of music and the sea's rhythm.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_5":"This is it! I can feel the entire beach responding to us.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_6":"We did it!","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_7":"As the melody perfectly synchronized with the waves, a rock on the beach slowly moved, revealing a secret passage to an underwater cave.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_8":"You have demonstrated wisdom in harmony with the ocean. You have passed this trial.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_9":"This is the second treasure, representing the sea.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_10":"What's this passage?","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_11":"It's the origin of the Zephyr Fest and the final trial location.","dialogue_summer2_10310_2_12":"Then let's proceed.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_1":"At the end of the passage deep within Zephyr Island, Nyx, and Nawi followed the small beast to a sacred cave. Inside the cave lay the enormous corpse of a zephyr spirit.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_2":"This is my father. Many years ago, he was severely injured in a storm. The mayor and residents of Zephyr Town saved him.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_3":"So, he decided to repay Zephyr Town in his way.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_4":"Is this the origin of the Zephyr Fest?","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_5":"Yes, every storm season, he would bring sea breezes to Zephyr Town, dispersing the storms.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_6":"The people of Zephyr Town hold the festival to thank my father.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_7":"Now, I have inherited his will and continue to protect this land.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_8":"The zephyr spirit's words carried a sense of sacred duty.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_9":"My father's magic crystal is the final treasure the mayor mentioned. If you can retrieve the crystal, you will complete the trials.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_10":"What exactly should we do?","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_11":"Approach my father and enter his lingering dream. In the dream, use your strength, wisdom, and united spirit to earn his approval.","dialogue_summer2_10315_1_12":"I understand, let's get started.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_1":"We did it. Now, let's retrieve the magic crystal and complete the trial.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_2":"Just as Nyx was about to retrieve the magic crystal, Parlok suddenly appeared and snatched it away.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_3":"Thank you for completing the trial. Now, this magic crystal will become the key to my control over Zephyr Town!","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_4":"How do you possess the power of the abyss?","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_5":"I simply made contact with a mysterious figure who promised me the power, to reclaim what should rightfully be mine.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_6":"I remember you. You're deceitful, defeated by my father in the dream realm.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_7":"That's only because I wasn't strong enough, right?","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_8":"It seems you were the one tracking us all along, wasn't it? My instincts have never been wrong.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_9":"So, the conflict with the guards at the beginning was intentional too?","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_10":"Thank you, all of you from Mirlond. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know how long it would take to obtain this magic crystal.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_11":"You greedy human, I'll never allow you to taint my father's power!","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_12":"As the zephyr spirit lunged at Parlok, his form began to fade gradually.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_13":"Don't waste your energy. If you want to stop me, come and try.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_14":"With the magic crystal, Parlok disappeared into the cave. People looked at each other, and eventually, Nyx approached the despondent zephyr spirit.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_15":"Don't worry, we won't let him succeed.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_16":"I believe in you.","dialogue_summer2_10315_2_17":"We mustn't delay. Let's hurry back to Zephyr Town.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_1":"On Zephyr Island, Aiushtha, Nyx, and Nawi stood in a secluded area surrounded by lush vegetation. Aiushtha concentrated, preparing to use her magic to create a portal.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_2":"A portal? But we don't have any marks for teleportation.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_3":"What do you mean we don't? Didn't you forget our clothes are still in Zephyr Town?","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_4":"While changing into swimwear, I left a magical mark. Now, I'll use it to take us back to Zephyr Town.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_5":"Why did you leave a mark on your clothes?","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_6":"It's not mine, it's the Omniguardian's.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_7":"...As expected of you.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_8":"We need to hurry. Parlok may have already begun his ritual.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_9":"It's almost complete.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_10":"Aiushtha finished the incantation, and a shimmering portal formed before them. They swiftly stepped into it.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_11":"Let's go, we don't have time!","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_12":"With a dazzling light, the three vanished into the portal.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_13":"In Zephyr Town, in Aiushtha's room, the three appeared the noise of the streets outside echoing continuously.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_14":"We're here, but it seems chaos has erupted outside.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_15":"Sounds like Parlok's minions are causing trouble.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_16":"We need to act immediately, find Parlok, and stop him.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_17":"The crowd emerged from the room, Parlok's minions rampaging arrogantly on the streets, terrifying the town's residents who scattered in fear.","dialogue_summer2_10401_1_18":"We can't let them rampage like this!","dialogue_summer2_10401_2_1":"After the battle, the group began to interrogate Parlok's minions, extracting some information. Once the questioning was over, Nawi casually knocked out one of the minions.","dialogue_summer2_10401_2_2":"According to this guy's confession, the ritual should be held at the zephyr altar outside of town.","dialogue_summer2_10401_2_3":"Then let's head there. We must stop Parlok's ritual as soon as possible.","dialogue_summer2_10401_2_4":"His abyssal power seems too suspicious, feels like it's from someone we'd rather not encounter.","dialogue_summer2_10401_2_5":"The group quickly departed from Zephyr Town, heading towards the direction of the ancient altar.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_1":"Outside the outskirts of Zephyr Town, the night was hazy, and the group hurried along the town's edge towards the ancient altar. Passing through a dense forest, they suddenly spotted faint lights and indistinct voices.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_2":"There's light, perhaps it's Parlok's people.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_3":"I'll cover us, let's approach quietly.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_4":"I can see a few figures there, they seem to be guarding something.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_5":"Utilizing the darkness and Aiushtha's concealment magic, the three stealthily approached the guards.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_6":"Who goes there?!","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_7":"We've been spotted.","dialogue_summer2_10405_1_8":"Then let's fight!","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_1":"After a skirmish, Aiushtha grabbed one of the guard's collars and started to inquire about information.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_2":"Where is Parlok conducting the ritual? Speak quickly!","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_3":"At the ancient altar on the Zephyr Cliff, but you're too late; the ceremony has already begun.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_4":"Upon learning that the ceremony had commenced, the three individuals grew even more anxious. They needed to act swiftly.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_5":"What are you guarding here?","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_6":"I was ordered to guard him, the former mayor of zephyr's town...","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_7":"Before he could finish his sentence, Nawi knocked out the guard.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_8":"I've already checked; there's a cellar here. The mayor and a few others might be imprisoned inside.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_9":"The three opened the cellar and found the mayor and several townsfolk imprisoned within. They quickly helped them break free from their restraints.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_10":"Hurry... Parlok captured us, he wants to take control of Zephyr Town on his own.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_11":"Mayor, we need your help. Can you tell us the exact location of the Zephyr Cliff?","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_12":"The mayor steadied himself and pointed towards the distance.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_13":"Do you see that cliff over there? The zephyr altar is at the top of that cliff.","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_14":"Are you coming with us?","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_15":"I can... uh...","dialogue_summer2_10405_2_16":"You should rest for now. We'll head there first.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_1":"The group arrived at the edge of Zephyr Cliff. On the altar, Parlok stood in the center, a magic crystal floating in his palm, emitting a dim glow.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_2":"Look, he's already begun the ceremony.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_3":"The power of that crystal is affecting the weather; the clouds are gathering.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_4":"Be careful, Parlok may have set traps.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_5":"The group stealthily approached the altar. Parlok seemed completely immersed in the ceremony, unaware of their arrival.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_6":"But just as they were about to launch their attack, powerful magic erupted from the ground around the altar. Parlok turned around a smug smile on his face.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_7":"Did you think you could stop me? Now, Zephyr will be under my control!","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_8":"Parlok activated a barrier and began summoning the power of storms and tsunamis. Thunder rumbled in the sky, and dark clouds gathered.","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_9":"You'll never succeed!","dialogue_summer2_10410_1_10":"Then you're here to stop me, huh!","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_1":"Hahaha, even though you defeated me, but... you will never save Zephyr Town!","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_2":"Nawi forcefully pressed his head to the ground, the tremendous impact knocking Parlok unconscious.","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_3":"Enough chatter.","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_4":"Why do you always enjoy knocking people out?","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_5":"I have no patience for scum like him.","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_6":"We've defeated him, but the ceremony has begun. We need to find a way to stop it.","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_7":"The crystal is the core of the ceremony; we must destroy it or...","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_8":"Or what?","dialogue_summer2_10410_2_9":"Or use it correctly to reverse the effects of the ceremony.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_1":"On Zephyr Cliff, around the ancient altar, dark clouds loomed overhead as a storm brewed. The group surrounded the altar, the magic crystal emitting a faint glow in their hands.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_2":"The power of the storm is gathering...","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_3":"Those are storm spirits... manifestations of the gathered storm power.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_4":"What do we do? With this storm spirit's power, the three of us must work together to have a chance at defeating it.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_5":"At that moment, the breathless mayor hurried over.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_6":"I'll perform the correct ritual... Please, hold it off for a moment.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_7":"Alright, the storm spirit is mine; Zephyr Town is yours.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_8":"Nyx handed the two treasures representing the sea and the wind to the mayor.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_9":"This is my duty as the mayor.","dialogue_summer2_10415_1_10":"The group fell silent, turning to face the approaching storm spirit, buying time for the mayor.","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_1":"In the name of Zephyr Town, the rulers of the sea, the lords of the wind, we summon you, ancient spirits of Zephyr Town!","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_2":"Please heed our plea and calm this storm!","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_3":"As the incantation progressed, runes on the altar lit up one by one, forming an array contrasting sharply with the swirling storm in the clouds.","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_4":"The glow of the crystal grew brighter, the light spreading from the altar to encompass the entire Zephyr Cliff, a barrier beginning to dispel the surrounding dark storm.","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_5":"We've done it; the storm is calming.","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_6":"Yes, Zephyr Town is saved.","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_7":"On behalf of Zephyr Town, thank you. Without you, the town would've been...","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_8":"It's the result of our collective effort.","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_9":"There are still two days until the Zephyr Fest; let's enjoy them to the fullest!","dialogue_summer2_10415_2_10":"As the storm dissipated completely, the sky over Zephyr Town cleared once more, sunlight bathing the land. People, under the gentle breeze, returned to the Town with smiles and laughter.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_1":"As night fell, the streets of the town were brightly lit, the entire town immersed in the joyous atmosphere.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_2":"Dressed in festival attire, holding lanterns, singing, and dancing, the townsfolk celebrated the calming of the storm and the victory of their heroes.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_3":"In this peaceful night, the people of Zephyr Town forgot the fear of yesterday, leaving only gratitude for the heroes and hope for the future.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_4":"Seeing everyone so happy, all the efforts were worth it.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_5":"Yes, our battle has brought about this joy and peace.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_6":"The mayor approached the three, raising a toast.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_7":"Allow me to express my deepest gratitude once again. You are our eternal heroes.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_8":"We only did what needed to be done, Mayor. It's the unity and courage of Zephyr Town that truly deserves praise.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_9":"It's been a while since I felt so relaxed.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_10":"The former zephyr spirit once said, 'The sea breeze, sometimes calm, sometimes wild, and so is our destiny.'","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_11":"Only by learning to adapt can we maintain our best state in the face of challenges.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_12":"I'm sorry, Omniguardian.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_13":"Why apologize?","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_14":"Nawi and I have been battling the Abyss for so long; that we've become somewhat numb.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_15":"Yes, I know we've been off lately, but the responsibility of guarding has always been on us...","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_16":"Look at the mayor, she also shoulders the responsibility of Zephyr Town, but...","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_17":"The mayor handles it much more adeptly than you two, don't you think?","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_18":"You're right.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_19":"Looking at the smiles of the residents, can't you guys relax a bit?","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_20":"Nyx didn't reply but turned to look into the distance, where with the climax of the celebration, the immense power of the zephyr spirit manifested, fireworks bursting in the sky, illuminating everyone's faces.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_21":"Under the glow of the fireworks, people laughed, sang, and danced, enjoying this rare moment of relaxation.","dialogue_summer2_10501_1_22":"Unconsciously, a hint of a smile appeared on everyone's lips...","dialogue_carnival01_10101_1":"To celebrate our 1st anniversary, Themis and Seraphina have prepared a special <color=#ffa352>surprise</color> for you.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_2":"How does the outfit fit?","dialogue_carnival01_10101_3":"The size is okay, but it's a bit tight around the chest.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_4":"Oh, it seems like Themis has her little troubles.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_5":"Compared to what I usually wear, this outfit feels light as a feather...","dialogue_carnival01_10101_6":"To surprise the Omniguardian, you've been adapting to this whimsical look.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_7":"You arrive at the agreed location, but it seems empty.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_8":"Hmm? Are they not here?","dialogue_carnival01_10101_9":"Hello, Omniguardian! Welcome to your very own carnival!","dialogue_carnival01_10101_10":"Welcome Omniguardian!","dialogue_carnival01_10101_11":"I wonder if we meet your expectations tonight?","dialogue_carnival01_10101_12":"(Gazes at them)","dialogue_carnival01_10101_13":"Don't just look at us, Omniguardian, everything here has been arranged especially for you.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_14":"This is our 1st anniversary celebration. We hope you have a wonderful time.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_15":"Please enjoy yourself. Tonight the neon lights will shine even brighter than the night itself.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_16":"Until the sun rises, everything here belongs to you, including us.","dialogue_carnival01_10101_17":"Now, let's start your very own <color=#ffa352>Euphoria Carnival</color>!","dialogue_carnival01_10102_1":"Omniguardian, you came at the right time. Would you like to play some pool with me?","dialogue_carnival01_10102_2":"Hmm... so be honest, I'm not very good at it yet. I might need you to teach me.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_3":"(Explains the rules to Themis)","dialogue_carnival01_10102_4":"Got it, let me give it a try.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_5":"Ah... Just listening to you isn't enough, I still need...","dialogue_carnival01_10102_6":"(Holds her hand to guide her)","dialogue_carnival01_10102_7":"Omniguardian, did you have a drink just now?","dialogue_carnival01_10102_8":"Your chest feels... a bit warm, I can feel it through your clothes.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_9":"And your hand is warm too. With you holding it, I seem to be getting more flustered.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_10":"Focus","dialogue_carnival01_10102_11":"Whew... That shot was great. With your help, it's different.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_12":"It's your turn now.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_13":"(Takes a shot)","dialogue_carnival01_10102_14":"That was a great hit, truly worthy of an Omniguardian!","dialogue_carnival01_10102_15":"With your help, I've got this!","dialogue_carnival01_10102_16":"This next shot is tricky; I need to change my angle.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_17":"My clothes are getting in the way, especially since it's tight around the chest.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_18":"I should have insisted on changing earlier.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_19":"Just the right position, this is going to be a perfect shot.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_20":"Omniguardian, are you staring at me?","dialogue_carnival01_10102_21":"Ahem... you fouled.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_22":"Oh no! The black eight!","dialogue_carnival01_10102_23":"I... ah... does this mean I lost this match?","dialogue_carnival01_10102_24":"Yes","dialogue_carnival01_10102_25":"No","dialogue_carnival01_10102_26":"Regardless, from the next match, I'll be seriously going against you.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_27":"On this special night, let's lighten this up with a wager.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_28":"The loser must be punished.","dialogue_carnival01_10102_29":"Omniguardian, what kind of <color=#ffa352>punishment</color> do you have in mind?","dialogue_carnival01_10102_30":"Take your time to think about it; after all, the night is still young, isn't it?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_1":"Omniguardian, welcome to my bar!","dialogue_carnival01_10103_2":"Want to try something different? I can mix a special drink for you.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_3":"There's a lot in common between healing and bartending. Healing is about mixing various medicines to cure wounds.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_4":"Mixing drinks creates unique and wonderful experiences for people.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_5":"You look a bit puzzled, Omniguardian. How about we play a little game?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_6":"Do you see the drink in my hand?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_7":"Take a guess, what kind of experience will I give you?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_8":"Guess right, and there's a reward!","dialogue_carnival01_10103_9":"Cooling down","dialogue_carnival01_10103_10":"Warming up","dialogue_carnival01_10103_11":"You guess half right.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_12":"It's not just about being hot or cold, it's something more special.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_13":"Why not try it and see for yourself?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_14":"(Takes the drink she offers)","dialogue_carnival01_10103_15":"The drink's temperature is still normal in your hands. Let me help you by giving you a sip.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_16":"Oh? Have you drunk quite a bit already? That means the unique experience will come even sooner.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_17":"Feel my skin with your hands and tell me what you feel.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_18":"(Touches her)","dialogue_carnival01_10103_19":"Look, the temperature here isn't high, yet your hand feels instantly warm, doesn't it?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_20":"This drink reflects your inner feelings and your body temperature.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_21":"Can you tell me what you're thinking?","dialogue_carnival01_10103_22":"You can whisper it to me alone, just in my ear.","dialogue_carnival01_10103_23":"I'll make your <color=#ffa352>wish</color> come true since it's just the two of us here.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_1":"Omniguardian, after tasting so many drinks, is there anything else that interests you?","dialogue_carnival01_10104_2":"If not, no worries, we can create a unique drink together.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_3":"It’s quite simple; just tell me what you’d like.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_4":"I have everything here.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_5":"It must be the variety of ingredients making it hard for you to choose.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_6":"Leave it to me.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_7":"First, select an alcohol with the right proof.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_8":"I prefer a slight buzz, it helps us confront our inner selves more easily.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_9":"Omniguardian, your face is already flushed. Is it because you’ve had too much to drink?","dialogue_carnival01_10104_10":"(Nods)","dialogue_carnival01_10104_11":"But your drinking capacity is quite impressive. You’ve had so much and are still standing strong.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_12":"Seeing you like this sparks an idea in my mind.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_13":"Allow me a bit of whimsy, this drink needs a special touch of creativity.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_14":"Now, we just need to add some decorations to the glass, and our unique drink will be complete.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_15":"(Chooses decorations)","dialogue_carnival01_10104_16":"Let me reiterate, this drink is ours alone. No one else can come near.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_17":"It’s designed to make you forget all worries temporarily, break free from constraints and do whatever you desire most.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_18":"Omniguardian, watch out! Ah, it's spilling! This drink…","dialogue_carnival01_10104_19":"Once it leaves the glass, it will evaporate instantly... And just smelling it will...","dialogue_carnival01_10104_20":"Just smelling it will compel you to do what you want. I’m already…","dialogue_carnival01_10104_21":"Omniguardian, the alcohol is taking control of my body. Are you feeling the same?","dialogue_carnival01_10104_22":"But that’s okay. Just for tonight, we can both indulge.","dialogue_carnival01_10104_23":"Before dawn, let's do what we... <color=#ffa352>most desire</color>.","dialogue_season5_10001_1_1":"Omniguardian, do you remember what happened when you first awoke?","dialogue_season5_10001_1_2":"At that time, Mirlond was under attack by the Abyss...","dialogue_season5_10001_1_3":"As a Guardian Valkyrie, I failed to fulfill the mission you entrusted to me.","dialogue_season5_10001_1_4":"I lost a crucial power, my Relic, the Flame Banner.","dialogue_season5_10001_1_5":"But now, I see a turning point.","dialogue_season5_10001_1_6":"The Flame Banner is calling out to me, the searing flames will guide us toward the era that belongs to you.","dialogue_season5_10001_1_7":"I'd like to invite you to accompany me in reclaiming that lost protection.","dialogue_season5_10001_1_8":"Please, take my hand. Being by your side is the true meaning of guardianship.","dialogue_season5_10101_1_1":"This ritual is to open the celestial ladder to the divine realm.","dialogue_season5_10101_1_2":"Through this opportunity, we shall pray to the gods so that the people will no longer lose their homes to war...","dialogue_season5_10101_1_3":"...And my warriors will no longer have to endure the agony of being unable to find peace in death.","dialogue_season5_10101_1_4":"A grand symphony begins to play as the Omniguardian and Eluller step out of the Eternal Gate, only to witness the Empress emerging in all her glory, revered by the crowd.","dialogue_season5_10101_1_5":"Omniguardian, it seems we've arrived in the Eastern lands once again.","dialogue_season5_10101_1_6":"What are those people doing? Why are they all bowing to that woman?","dialogue_season5_10101_1_7":"How dare you intrude upon this sacred ritual!","dialogue_season5_10101_1_8":"With a firm exclamation, the Empress sends a golden scroll from her sleeve, radiating an aura of royal authority, straight toward Eluller!","dialogue_season5_10101_1_9":"Kneel before me, all of you!","dialogue_season5_10101_1_10":"Eluller, step back!","dialogue_season5_10101_2_1":"Omniguardian, I've troubled you again…","dialogue_season5_10101_2_2":"As long as you're safe, that's all that matters.","dialogue_season5_10101_2_3":"Please prioritize your own safety! You are the very reason for my existence.","dialogue_season5_10101_2_4":"To think you could evade my Scroll of Atonement. Who exactly are you people?","dialogue_season5_10101_2_5":"And who are you?","dialogue_season5_10101_2_6":"I am the sovereign who rules the mortal realm, Wu Zetian.","dialogue_season5_10101_2_7":"As the tension rises, a man in heavy armor rushes in, dropping to his knees before Wu Zetian.","dialogue_season5_10101_2_8":"Your Majesty, something terrible has happened!","dialogue_season5_10101_2_9":"In military affairs, there must be no panic. What has occurred?","dialogue_season5_10101_2_10":"The reinforcements of the Undead Legion have arrived. They're breaking through our right-wing defenses and will be upon us any moment!","dialogue_season5_10101_2_11":"What?!","dialogue_season5_10105_1_1":"On the battlefield, covered in searing flames, two armies are locked in relentless combat.","dialogue_season5_10105_1_2":"Your Majesty, the front lines are dangerous!","dialogue_season5_10105_1_3":"The Undead Legion cannot be killed by ordinary weapons. Please evacuate as soon as possible!","dialogue_season5_10105_1_4":"Retreating would mean accepting that we are defeated.","dialogue_season5_10105_1_5":"The front-line soldiers are still fighting bravely; how can I stay safely behind?","dialogue_season5_10105_1_6":"Looks like you're in trouble.","dialogue_season5_10105_1_7":"If you're not enemies, heed my advice: find a way to get out of here.","dialogue_season5_10105_1_8":"The enemy we face is an invincible undead force.","dialogue_season5_10105_1_9":"As if to prove Wu Zetian's words, the howls of the undead grow ever closer, approaching the position of everyone.","dialogue_season5_10105_1_10":"The enemy is closing in! Protect the Majesty!!","dialogue_season5_10105_1_11":"No need for protection; I will fight alongside you!","dialogue_season5_10105_1_12":"My brave warriors, let us tear through the enemy's encirclement, together!","dialogue_season5_10105_1_13":"We must survive!","dialogue_season5_10105_2_1":"How strange. After you joined the battle, the Undead Legion's resurrection speed seems to have been reduced...","dialogue_season5_10105_2_2":"I don't know why, but while fighting for the Omniguardian just now, a searing power surged within me.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_3":"Perhaps it is the Omniguardian's blessing that has given me the courage to overcome death.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_4":"Such a powerful force exists in the world! Could it be... that you are some deity we have never seen before?","dialogue_season5_10105_2_5":"No, if you were truly a deity, you wouldn't be helping me.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_6":"It might be that the Flame Banner sensed my presence and enhanced our strength.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_7":"Let me try to sense it...","dialogue_season5_10105_2_8":"Eluller closes her eyes, places her hands flat on the ground, and her whole body then erupts in a blazing fire illusion.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_9":"This is strange...","dialogue_season5_10105_2_10":"The Flame Banner seems to be... beneath us?","dialogue_season5_10105_2_11":"The Flame Banner? I have used that magical weapon before.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_12":"When the banner's crimson flames spread across the formation, victory would favor my soldiers.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_13":"Unfortunately, it has already been taken by the enemy.","dialogue_season5_10105_2_14":"Who exactly is your enemy?","dialogue_season5_10105_2_15":"...It's a long story. Let's break through first!","dialogue_season5_10110_1_1":"The people fight and fall back, their efforts to hinder the undead enemies showing clear signs of fatigue among Wu Zetian's soldiers.","dialogue_season5_10110_1_2":"The enemies are truly relentless. What kind of hatred drives them?","dialogue_season5_10110_1_3":"You, who possess such great power, are still so ignorant of the world?","dialogue_season5_10110_1_4":"Wu Zetian's expression darkens, as if recalling an unpleasant past.","dialogue_season5_10110_1_5":"Mortals possess the lands of the earthly realm, while the heavens and the underworld belong to the great gods.","dialogue_season5_10110_1_6":"In the divine realm, the Underworld Lord commands the power of death, controlling the living and adjudicating the undead.","dialogue_season5_10110_1_7":"His power is so immense that he can turn the mortal world into a hell without even exerting his full strength.","dialogue_season5_10110_1_8":"He is our enemy, the master whom the Undead Legion serves, Underworld Lord Hades.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_1":"The group barely breaks through the hellish encirclement, and the soldiers suffer heavy casualties.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_2":"We're safe for now.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_3":"From what you're saying, those enemies must be Hades's legion, right?","dialogue_season5_10110_2_4":"This is close to divine punishment. What conflict has arisen between humans and the gods?","dialogue_season5_10110_2_5":"Because...","dialogue_season5_10110_2_6":"Wu Zetian bites her lip, showing a look of reluctance.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_7":"He did indeed defeat me easily and take the Flame Banner.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_8":"Omniguardian, it seems we now have a goal.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_9":"The sudden sound of wailing draws everyone's attention.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_10":"No, don't. I don't want to die. I don't want to be buried in the pit with them!","dialogue_season5_10110_2_11":"What are you saying?!","dialogue_season5_10110_2_12":"Oh great god, please reverse death and let us become members of your Undead Legion!","dialogue_season5_10110_2_13":"The fallen soldiers are rising again?!","dialogue_season5_10110_2_14":"Be careful, they no longer belong to the mortal realm.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_15":"Hades can transform our fallen human soldiers into his Undead Legion.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_16":"That's why I need to perform a specific burial ritual to ensure they truly die and are not turned by Hades.","dialogue_season5_10110_2_17":"But is it already too late...","dialogue_season5_10110_2_18":"The fallen heroes should not be exploited... Such actions are unforgivable!","dialogue_season5_10115_2_1":"I don't... I don't want to die...","dialogue_season5_10115_2_2":"Just before the general is fully transformed, a spear thrusts out of nowhere, ending his mutation.","dialogue_season5_10115_2_3":"That was close. Luckily, I arrived in time!","dialogue_season5_10115_2_4":"And you are?","dialogue_season5_10115_2_5":"I am Lancelot. Your Majesty, and the two of you, are you all right?","dialogue_season5_10115_2_6":"How do you know me?","dialogue_season5_10115_2_7":"My family has served the royal family for generations. I have come to serve you as well.","dialogue_season5_10115_2_8":"That was indeed dangerous. Ah, but since you ascended the throne as a child, you must have seen many such scenes.","dialogue_season5_10115_2_9":"The internal factional struggles within the empire have drained much of my energy. Relying on your protection has allowed me to govern until now.","dialogue_season5_10115_2_10":"Your subordinates are very loyal to you.","dialogue_season5_10115_2_11":"…If they knew the reason for the divine punishment, they might not follow me anymore.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_1":"A mobile palace appears before the group, its grand and imposing structure like an undying beacon on the battlefield.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_2":"Please follow me. There is something I wish to discuss with you.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_3":"After entering the palace, Wu Zetian reclines slightly on a soft couch, gently massaging her temples with delicate, pale fingers.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_4":"After briefly collecting her thoughts, her gaze becomes resolute once more.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_5":"You've likely seen the dire situation my army is in.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_6":"My soldiers are mere mortals. Once killed by the enemy, they are transformed into members of the Undead Legion.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_7":"The living are limited, and we are becoming increasingly outmatched.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_8":"So I hope that your power can be of use to me.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_9":"Or rather, I hope to use your power to save innocent people from the hands of a cruel god.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_10":"You still haven't told us the reason for this war.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_11":"When I was young, I inherited this heavy burden of an empire.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_12":"To protect the lands my ancestors guarded for generations, I needed a strong and invincible army.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_13":"I made a mistake. I stole the power of the Underworld Lord, Hades, and transformed my army, bringing the undead to the mortal realm.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_14":"Even though I quickly laid my undead soldiers to rest, the gods still noticed the imbalance.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_15":"When the Underworld Lord realized that his power had been stolen by a mere mortal, his wrath was unimaginable.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_16":"The group looks outside the palace, where the earth struggles to survive under the assault of Eternal Infernos.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_17":"But... my family and I have survived because of you, Your Majesty...","dialogue_season5_10201_1_18":"Wait, something's wrong outside!","dialogue_season5_10201_1_19":"Dark clouds press down, descending upon the last beacon of light on the battlefield.","dialogue_season5_10201_1_20":"It's Hades's Undead Legion! They've hidden in the shadows and infiltrated the palace!","dialogue_season5_10201_1_21":"Get ready to fight!","dialogue_season5_10201_2_1":"Ugh!!","dialogue_season5_10201_2_2":"You're injured!","dialogue_season5_10201_2_3":"It's just a small wound. Winning is what matters.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_4":"Lancelot hides his injured arm behind his back and grins broadly.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_5":"...There are already too many injured.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_6":"That's why I need you to take me to Hades.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_7":"I want to face the wrath of a god, even if it's like a moth to a flame, as long as there's a chance to end this divine punishment.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_8":"Even if the cost might be your life?","dialogue_season5_10201_2_9":"As Empress, it's my duty to bear the consequences of angering a god.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_10":"We will help you face your fate.","dialogue_season5_10201_2_11":"Perfect. My Relic is also in the underworld, so it's necessary to pay a visit to that arrogant god.","dialogue_season5_10204_1_1":"But our destination is the underworld, a realm that doesn't exist in the mortal world. How are we supposed to get there…?","dialogue_season5_10204_1_2":"Hehe, interesting…","dialogue_season5_10204_2_1":"I am the goddess of love and beauty, the pure and flawless Aphrodite.","dialogue_season5_10204_2_2":"So, it was you who disturbed my beautiful dreams.","dialogue_season5_10204_2_3":"Earlier, the seal on the celestial ladder was shaken by a force from the mortal realm. Your efforts even took me by surprise.","dialogue_season5_10204_2_4":"But, Empress of the human world…","dialogue_season5_10204_2_5":"Daring to defy the gods with a mere mortal body, should I commend your bravery, or call you utterly foolish?","dialogue_season5_10204_2_6":"Let me first see if you have the right to make such bold claims!","dialogue_season5_10205_2_1":"Oh my, how could you be so rough and scratch my flawless face?","dialogue_season5_10205_2_2":"Omniguardian, don't be fooled by her. She's not actually injured and is holding something back.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_3":"My, my, little girl, you're quite fond of this man, aren't you? Is this what you mortals call loyalty?","dialogue_season5_10205_2_4":"Yes. Because I've met the Omniguardian, someone truly worthy of my unwavering devotion.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_5":"Oh? So you're using the power of love to oppose me, a goddess… How intriguing.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_6":"But I, on the other hand, hope to see this world become more lively.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_7":"The divine realm has been peaceful for too long. Only through bloodshed and the pain of parting can the purest love and desire be born.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_8":"Let me indulge your blasphemous fantasies then.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_9":"Remember, if you wish to enter the underworld, you must first pass through the boundary between life and death, the Underworld River Phlegethon.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_10":"Be sure to reach it safely.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_11":"I'm waiting for the entertainment you mortals will provide… Good luck!","dialogue_season5_10205_2_12":"Aphrodite's figure dissolves into foam, dissipating into the wind as she points out the direction of the Underworld River.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_13":"Now that we have the clue, let's set out immediately.","dialogue_season5_10205_2_14":"Yes, Your Majesty!","dialogue_season5_10210_1_1":"The surroundings change.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_2":"This isn't the mortal realm… The air here is far too heavy with death.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_3":"We've arrived at the Underworld River.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_4":"Be careful, something feels off.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_5":"Omniguardian, I think I hear faint bell chimes…","dialogue_season5_10210_1_6":"As the echo of the chimes grows clearer, the water's surface becomes disturbed.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_7":"In the next moment, a pitch-black longboat breaks through the water! The bow lights up with Nether Flames, illuminating a massive and oppressive shadow.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_8":"Crack… crack…","dialogue_season5_10210_1_9":"It's Charon, the ferryman! He's the guardian of the river, and incredibly powerful!","dialogue_season5_10210_1_10":"The Undead Legion is following behind him as well!","dialogue_season5_10210_1_11":"It seems the enemy doesn't intend to let us leave this place.","dialogue_season5_10210_1_12":"Such a warm welcome for us, indeed.","dialogue_season5_10215_1_1":"The group repels the Undead Legion that surges towards them. Charon rings his bell again, and the Nether Flames infuse strength into the relentless legion.","dialogue_season5_10215_1_2":"The enemy's resurrection speed in the underworld is increasing, and our strength is rapidly depleting!","dialogue_season5_10215_1_3":"Prioritize attacking Charon!","dialogue_season5_10215_1_4":"The Omniguardian is right; we must first take down the commander!","dialogue_season5_10215_1_5":"As Empress, I am not someone you can defeat with your unrelenting disregard for death!","dialogue_season5_10301_1_1":"After defeating the ferryman of the underworld, the Undead Legion dispatched by Charon loses its ability to resurrect.","dialogue_season5_10301_1_2":"Seize the opportunity and defeat them!","dialogue_season5_10301_1_3":"Yes!","dialogue_season5_10301_1_4":"Let my spear see you off on your journey to your doom!","dialogue_season5_10301_2_1":"Enemies fall one after another, and the deadly silent river surface suddenly boils with activity.","dialogue_season5_10301_2_2":"Ouch, it's so hot!","dialogue_season5_10301_2_3":"Is there something in the river?","dialogue_season5_10301_2_4":"It's him…!","dialogue_season5_10301_2_5":"In Wu Zetian's fearful gaze, the Nether Flames spread outward from the center of the river.","dialogue_season5_10301_2_6":"Amid the burning illusion, the group hears a cold and harsh question.","dialogue_season5_10301_2_7":"Mortals, why do you disturb the gods' rest?","dialogue_season5_10301_2_8":"It's Hades, the Underworld Lord!","dialogue_season5_10305_1_1":"As the last enemy falls, a tall figure rises from the dark depths of the river, its imposing stature revealing its noble identity.","dialogue_season5_10305_1_2":"Mortal, how dare you speak the name of a god so casually?","dialogue_season5_10305_1_3":"Lord Hades, please withdraw your divine punishment!","dialogue_season5_10305_1_4":"I alone will bear all the sins incurred!","dialogue_season5_10305_1_5":"Haha... Hahahaha.","dialogue_season5_10305_1_6":"Amid Hades's mocking laughter, the Undead Legion that had just fallen is once again empowered and charges at the group, enveloped in boiling Nether Flames!","dialogue_season5_10305_1_7":"How laughable.","dialogue_season5_10305_1_8":"I allow you to gaze upon a god with mortal eyes merely as a reward for your bravery in fighting this far.","dialogue_season5_10305_1_9":"But how dare you claim you wish to stop a god from fulfilling His will on this world?","dialogue_season5_10305_1_10":"Now, face your own weakness!","dialogue_season5_10310_1_1":"Your power... bears the mark of Aphrodite.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_2":"No wonder you could locate the river and even kill the loyal Charon.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_3":"That woman is probably hiding somewhere, watching the chaos she stirred.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_4":"She's a disgrace to the gods!","dialogue_season5_10310_1_5":"Hades raises his trident high and brings it down hard upon the river's surface.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_6":"It's like a warning. Almost immediately, the blazing Nether Flames on the river are replaced by delicate rose petals, and Aphrodite appears.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_7":"Lord Hades, you summoned me in such a dramatic fashion. Do you have urgent business?","dialogue_season5_10310_1_8":"Handle the trouble you've caused yourself.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_9":"I haven't done anything...","dialogue_season5_10310_1_10":"Hades turns and leaves, his cold back the only thing left for Aphrodite to see.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_11":"Ah, those cast into the underworld clearly lack manners.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_12":"We can join forces to defeat him.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_13":"Your suggestion is bold, but have you considered... you are clearly blaspheming against the gods.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_14":"I admit I am curious to experience what it's like to be with humans.","dialogue_season5_10310_1_15":"But you must first prove that you deserve a place by my side.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_1":"Heh, I'm beginning to believe that you truly have the power to defeat that man.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_2":"Allow me to give you an extra edge in your victory.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_3":"The sacred battle flag, glowing with red flames, unfurls in Aphrodite's hand.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_4":"The Flame Banner!","dialogue_season5_10310_2_5":"Shh. I secretly took it while he was away.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_6":"After defeating the Undead Legion, you can use it to purify the undead and turn them into your own forces.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_7":"I'm looking forward to seeing the arrogant Hades's reaction when he realizes his defeat… Ha, I'm already feeling better!","dialogue_season5_10310_2_8":"Next, you can't be trapped here with me.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_9":"Once Lord Hades returns to the underworld, you won't be able to find where he slumbers.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_10":"After all, as living beings, you can't truly enter the underground world.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_11":"Then let us pass.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_12":"That won't happen. I am the face of the divine realm and can't afford to lose.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_13":"But if your companions are willing to stay and fight me, then no one would dare accuse me of dereliction.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_14":"Of course, I won't show mercy to you.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_15":"As a god, I will not ally myself with the weak.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_16":"You go ahead; I'll stay behind to hold her off!","dialogue_season5_10310_2_17":"Don't be reckless; you'll die!","dialogue_season5_10310_2_18":"Miss Eluller and the Omniguardian are far stronger than I am. They can provide you with more assistance!","dialogue_season5_10310_2_19":"As for me… even if I die here, I won't have any regrets.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_20":"Because I have long been dead.","dialogue_season5_10310_2_21":"Now standing before you is the warrior you personally revived, the Undying Lancelot.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_1":"Are you… one of the undead I revived back then?","dialogue_season5_10315_1_2":"Yes. I died during the empire's collapse, amidst that brutal chaos.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_3":"How could this be… I thought I had already buried you all…","dialogue_season5_10315_1_4":"Hades discovered our presence and would not allow us to enter the underworld.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_5":"There are many wandering souls in the Underworld River… They were my comrades.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_6":"I almost fell into despair like them. But your efforts gave me a glimmer of hope.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_7":"It is you who made me believe that our barren homeland would once again yield crops, and that the descendants of our clan would have enough to eat.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_8":"And I destroyed your vision with my own hands…","dialogue_season5_10315_1_9":"But you truly led us into a new era.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_10":"At this moment, I am grateful to be an undead warrior.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_11":"It gives me a chance to fight for the future of the living.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_12":"Lancelot brandishes his heavy spear. Amidst the rain of roses, vibrant spider lilies mix in.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_13":"Let me offer this death, symbolizing loyalty and ideals, for your vision.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_14":"…Both I and the living world will remember your sacrifice.","dialogue_season5_10315_1_15":"Don't waste any more time. Let's go!","dialogue_season5_10315_1_16":"Lady Aphrodite, though this might be a bit presumptuous, please offer your guidance!","dialogue_season5_10315_1_17":"Well, you're a quick learner. Let me teach you a dance, loyal little dog!","dialogue_season5_10401_1_1":"We've lost track of Hades!","dialogue_season5_10401_1_2":"But I can faintly sense the Relic's call; we must be heading in the right direction.","dialogue_season5_10401_1_3":"The River Phlegethon lies at the boundary between life and death. Entering the underworld is likely not that simple.","dialogue_season5_10401_1_4":"I almost forgot, you mentioned you once stole Hades's power...","dialogue_season5_10401_1_5":"Have you ever entered the underworld yourself?","dialogue_season5_10401_1_6":"...Yes.","dialogue_season5_10401_1_7":"But that time, it was through the efforts of many sorcerers who performed a ritual to separate my soul from my body.","dialogue_season5_10401_1_8":"Wait, Aphrodite once said, \"as living beings\"...","dialogue_season5_10401_1_9":"So, death might be a way to pass through...","dialogue_season5_10401_1_10":"...It's worth a try.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_1":"Wu Zetian turns to the Omniguardian, her gaze filled with reluctance but even more with determination.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_2":"You've all helped me greatly along this journey.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_3":"I… once never trusted anyone, nor did I ever rely on anyone.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_4":"As the ruler of the empire, my power and the position I held allowed me to see only endless solitude.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_5":"And that solitude was something I could never share with the world.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_6":"But you're different. For the first time, you made me feel that there are others like me, who strive to protect this mortal realm.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_7":"However, the path ahead is one I must walk alone.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_8":"Because...","dialogue_season5_10401_2_9":"Wu Zetian picks up a sword, pressing it against her slender, graceful neck.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_10":"I cannot let you accompany me in death.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_11":"My sins are mine alone to atone for.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_12":"You don't need to follow me!","dialogue_season5_10401_2_13":"Blood splatters! The human body falls slowly to the ground.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_14":"Is this… the only way?!","dialogue_season5_10401_2_15":"Eluller, take my hand.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_16":"Omniguardian?","dialogue_season5_10401_2_17":"Do you remember? On the Datonement day, when I entered the Covenant Temple in spirit form.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_18":"Yes! Over the long millennia, you've borne the corruption of our fallen selves in that form!","dialogue_season5_10401_2_19":"Let me try to recapture that feeling.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_20":"Eluller takes hold of the hand extended by the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_21":"Omniguardian, I'm ready.","dialogue_season5_10401_2_22":"Let's go.","dialogue_season5_10405_1_1":"After enduring excruciating pain, Wu Zetian finds herself in a completely chaotic afterworld.","dialogue_season5_10405_1_2":"This is the underworld, the fabled land of death...","dialogue_season5_10405_1_3":"Where is he?","dialogue_season5_10405_1_4":"How did you follow me here?!","dialogue_season5_10405_1_5":"The burden of saving the mortal realm is one I want to share with you.","dialogue_season5_10405_1_6":"That's right. We can't let you have all the glory.","dialogue_season5_10405_1_7":"Wu Zetian falls silent for a moment, but then the previous gloom lifts as she reveals a renewed fighting spirit.","dialogue_season5_10405_1_8":"Since you're here, let's move forward together.","dialogue_season5_10405_1_9":"Heh heh... heh heh heh...","dialogue_season5_10405_1_10":"But before we proceed, we need to clear the path ahead first.","dialogue_season5_10405_2_1":"More undead awaken from their slumber, the Nether Flames burning in their eyes illuminating the chaotic realm.","dialogue_season5_10405_2_2":"In the distance, a towering, icy throne comes into view.","dialogue_season5_10405_2_3":"That throne... it's the resting place of Hades!","dialogue_season5_10405_2_4":"What we need to do next is simple.","dialogue_season5_10405_2_5":"That is, to carve a path forward!","dialogue_season5_10409_1_1":"In the land of death, now turned battlefield, the slumbering god finally stirs from his deep sleep.","dialogue_season5_10409_2_1":"Mortals, do not parade your earthly righteousness before the all-knowing gods.","dialogue_season5_10409_2_2":"The divine punishment upon the mortal realm is your doing.","dialogue_season5_10409_2_3":"Those who dare wield the power of the undead shall inevitably face its consequences.","dialogue_season5_10409_2_4":"Hades casually scatters Nether Flames, and the green sparks that fall to the ground coalesce into a familiar form.","dialogue_season5_10409_2_5":"No, this can't be... it's him...","dialogue_season5_10409_2_6":"Since you intend to return my power, then he shall become a part of me.","dialogue_season5_10409_2_7":"He once called himself the Undying Lancelot. Now, let your most loyal warrior be the one to see you off.","dialogue_season5_10410_2_1":"Your... Majesty...","dialogue_season5_10410_2_2":"The bloodied knight trembles as he bows his head.","dialogue_season5_10410_2_3":"Lancelot has failed you… I…","dialogue_season5_10410_2_4":"You've done well.","dialogue_season5_10410_2_5":"I once thought that loyalty was nothing more than a servant of power.","dialogue_season5_10410_2_6":"That's why I was so desperate to strengthen my army, even to the point of stealing the power of the undead.","dialogue_season5_10410_2_7":"But you… you changed my mind. Thank you for honoring me as your Empress.","dialogue_season5_10410_2_8":"The battle ahead... Leave it to me.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_1":"The battle purifies Lancelot's soul. Eluller wields the Flame Banner, shielding the knight from Hades's control, allowing him to fight solely for his own ideals.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_2":"The path to the throne lies open.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_3":"What a foolish endeavor.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_4":"I… I've slain the warrior who was loyal to me with my own hands.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_5":"It's all for this moment, the final battle against a god.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_6":"Do you think you stand a chance?","dialogue_season5_10415_1_7":"Perhaps not.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_8":"But my ambition remains unchanged.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_9":"I will defeat you, make you revoke your divine punishment, and restore life to its natural order.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_10":"I'll use any means necessary to achieve that goal.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_11":"…Impressive courage.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_12":"Then come, try this blasphemous act you so crave.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_13":"Your ambition will be crushed by my own divine hand.","dialogue_season5_10415_1_14":"I will wager all the hopes of humanity, just to shatter the fate decreed by the gods!","dialogue_season5_10415_2_1":"Impossible...","dialogue_season5_10415_2_2":"How could mere mortals defeat a god?!","dialogue_season5_10415_2_3":"Eluller, Omniguardian, thank you both for fighting alongside me.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_4":"Without your help, I wouldn't have made it this far on my own.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_5":"The most important thing was the hope you brought us.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_6":"Now, go do what you must.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_7":"Alright...","dialogue_season5_10415_2_8":"Lord Hades, I have sincerely repented. Please retract the power of the undead and lift the divine punishment.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_9":"I refuse.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_10":"You...!","dialogue_season5_10415_2_11":"Unless you tell me what power allowed you to defeat me.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_12":"...","dialogue_season5_10415_2_13":"Perhaps ruling the mortal realm isn't about absolute power and strength.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_14":"It's about an unrealistic ambition, a desire to make the world willingly submit.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_15":"That's unheard of...","dialogue_season5_10415_2_16":"Very well, I will respect the outcome and recall the Undead Legion from the mortal realm.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_17":"However, this also means that you will no longer have the power of the undead to escape death.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_18":"One day, you will lose your eternal strength and authority, and you will become just another lost soul.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_19":"That would be for the best.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_20":"The fear of death will make me cherish every moment of life.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_21":"In my lifetime, I vow to bring peace to the world.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_22":"Then let it be as you wish.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_23":"Hades raises his trident, and countless rays of light converge upon it.","dialogue_season5_10415_2_24":"In that light, a symbol of hope, the forces that threatened the mortal realm are completely dispelled...","dialogue_season5_10415_2_25":"The era of peace has arrived.","dialogue_season6_10001_1_1":"Omniguardian, under your protection, we've gathered all the Valkyries' Relics.","dialogue_season6_10001_1_2":"Now, Mirlond no longer fears those formidable enemies from beyond this world.","dialogue_season6_10001_1_3":"But what we possess is merely a fighting chance, not the certainty of victory.","dialogue_season6_10001_1_4":"We must continue to strengthen ourselves, seek out more powerful allies, and uncover weapons capable of turning the tide.","dialogue_season6_10001_1_5":"Let's set off on another journey, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season6_10001_1_6":"No matter the dangers ahead, I'm ready to face them by your side.","dialogue_season6_10101_1_1":"Hurry...","dialogue_season6_10101_1_2":"Amid the howling winds, the messenger rushes forward, eyes fixed on the path ahead.","dialogue_season6_10101_1_3":"His destination, Camelot, stands just beyond this snowy ridge.","dialogue_season6_10101_1_4":"I can make it. I can make it...","dialogue_season6_10101_1_5":"Those snow monsters are slow; they rarely chase this close to the capital...","dialogue_season6_10101_1_6":"I just need to move a little faster.","dialogue_season6_10101_1_7":"As he hurries forward, his foot suddenly catches on a tree branch hidden beneath the snow, sending him stumbling to the ground.","dialogue_season6_10101_1_8":"Ugh! The letter... the letter is safe... that's all that matters...","dialogue_season6_10101_1_9":"Ahhh!! I'm so hungry… and thirsty…","dialogue_season6_10101_1_10":"Fresh human, warm blood and meat… let me have a taste! Let me have a taste!!","dialogue_season6_10101_1_11":"No… no… they are catching up!!","dialogue_season6_10101_1_12":"The messenger panics, trying to scramble back to his feet, but the shadow looms closer.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_1":"You shouldn't have run.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_2":"Surrender your life, and I'll guide you to the Underworld River.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_3":"Omniguardian, we're in luck.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_4":"Finding a living soul in this freezing wasteland must be a miracle you've brought us.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_5":"Are you here to throw your life away too?","dialogue_season6_10101_2_6":"Bold words. Do you have the strength to back them up?","dialogue_season6_10101_2_7":"I've lingered here long enough.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_8":"Roar, roar!","dialogue_season6_10101_2_9":"I'll leave this to you. Don't disappoint me.","dialogue_season6_10101_2_10":"Roar!","dialogue_season6_10101_3_1":"The monster has retreated for now. Stranger, are you all right?","dialogue_season6_10101_3_2":"The messenger doesn't respond, just staring blankly at the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_3":"Such noble features and character... could you be from Camelot?","dialogue_season6_10101_3_4":"Camelot?","dialogue_season6_10101_3_5":"Allow me to stand, straighten my back, and praise the greatness of Camelot.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_6":"It is the city of glory, an unbreakable fortress. It is the court of the honorable King Arthur.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_7":"Please, come with me to Camelot. My king will surely welcome a hero like you with open arms.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_8":"And escort you back safely, right?","dialogue_season6_10101_3_9":"I am the king's messenger, with a heavy responsibility. But as you can see... I am far too weak.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_10":"We need to learn more about this world.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_11":"The view from a giant's shoulders is always clearer.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_12":"It seems the Omniguardian has agreed to your request. Stay close.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_13":"In the distance, faint howls of snow monsters echo.","dialogue_season6_10101_3_14":"This journey won't be easy.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_1":"Bastet fights bravely, finally forcing the snow monsters to change their tactics. They follow closely behind, launching attacks whenever they can.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_2":"A bunch of sly rats, waiting for the hunter to tire out.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_3":"We're almost there! Once we get over this ridge, we'll see the walls of Camelot.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_4":"Those walls are the strongest defense, a symbol of never falling, home to the Knights of the Round Table.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_5":"If we call for help, the knights of Camelot will surely come to our aid!","dialogue_season6_10105_1_6":"Roar, roar!","dialogue_season6_10105_1_7":"They're trying to stop us from reaching the walls.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_8":"Annoying pests. Messenger, go over the ridge and request the knights' help.","dialogue_season6_10105_1_9":"Yes!","dialogue_season6_10105_1_10":"You monsters have dared to anger a sleeping cat. Get ready to be torn apart by my claws!","dialogue_season6_10105_2_1":"Where's the messenger?","dialogue_season6_10105_2_2":"He said he was going for help. Why isn't he back yet?","dialogue_season6_10105_2_3":"Let's go check.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_4":"The Omniguardian and Bastet crest the hill, only to find the messenger standing in the snow, staring blankly toward the capital.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_5":"It's gone...","dialogue_season6_10105_2_6":"What's gone?","dialogue_season6_10105_2_7":"The walls.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_8":"With trembling hands, the messenger points ahead. The city is defenseless, the once impenetrable walls of Camelot have vanished.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_9":"There are no knights in sight.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_10":"Heh! Hahahaha!","dialogue_season6_10105_2_11":"Those monsters… are they laughing?","dialogue_season6_10105_2_12":"They think we're stranded without help.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_13":"They are the ones who are stranded.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_14":"Rawwwrrrr!","dialogue_season6_10105_2_15":"Bastet, watch above!","dialogue_season6_10105_2_16":"I see it.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_17":"Get down!","dialogue_season6_10105_2_18":"A golden flash of a sword slices overhead. Several snow monsters, ready to ambush, are instantly beheaded.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_19":"From the direction of Camelot, a figure on a white horse rides swiftly toward the group.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_20":"Be cautious. These snow monsters are tricky.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_21":"My king? Why have you come in person!","dialogue_season6_10105_2_22":"The Knights of Camelot don't abandon those in need.","dialogue_season6_10105_2_23":"The walls have fallen. Come with me into the city.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_1":"The clang of hammers echoes through the forge as the blacksmiths work tirelessly.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_2":"Thin sheets of metal are repeatedly tempered on the anvil, finally revealing a sharp edge.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_3":"A messenger has brought urgent news from the North.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_4":"The North has suffered greatly. We've lost 600 capable workers.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_5":"Things are even worse in the western territories. Years of relentless blizzards have ravaged the area, and the number of livestock being sent in continues to decline each year.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_6":"The situation in Camelot is dire too.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_7":"In the last raid, the snow monsters destroyed part of the city wall, and many knights were lost...","dialogue_season6_10110_1_8":"Their conversation halts as the strategist sneezes, shivering.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_9":"It's so cold...","dialogue_season6_10110_1_10":"If all the firewood hadn't been taken from the palace to the forge, we wouldn't be freezing in here...","dialogue_season6_10110_1_11":"With the walls destroyed, this is the time we must arm ourselves the most.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_12":"My king, we also need to find ways to reduce losses and boost morale...","dialogue_season6_10110_1_13":"The people need a victory.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_14":"But... this is defying the gods.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_15":"The unending blizzard is the work of the Empress of the Underworld, Lady Elisha.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_16":"The hammer strikes down again with a decisive blow. Instantly, a golden-red glow fills the forge.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_17":"The blacksmith lifts the newly forged Relic in both hands, respectfully offering it to Arthur.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_18":"It's a fine weapon. Does it have a name?","dialogue_season6_10110_1_19":"Soulbinding Lance.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_20":"It's my knight's lance, but it was cursed by the endless blizzard.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_21":"I had the blacksmith reforge it. I hope it handles well.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_22":"My king! Snow monsters have been spotted outside the city, preparing to attack!","dialogue_season6_10110_1_23":"You were just worried the Relic might not be ready, and now the grindstone has come to us.","dialogue_season6_10110_1_24":"Let those monsters who dare to threaten my people feel the wrath of a king.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_1":"The snow monsters reluctantly retreat for now, but the cold wind remains fierce.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_2":"Arthur plants his sword before Camelot, as if he were the last bastion.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_3":"We can fall back to Camlann and plan our next move...","dialogue_season6_10115_1_4":"No.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_5":"I am the king of Camelot, the protector of all my people.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_6":"I will raise my sword against Elisha's underworld and put an end to this blizzard.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_7":"Spring and harvest will return once my sacrilege is complete.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_8":"As the blizzard eases, the king of Camelot walks with determination toward the city gate, tears in the eyes of the people watching him leave.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_9":"He seems to linger in his steps, savoring everything this land has to offer.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_10":"He knows he may not return.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_11":"Perhaps solitude is a remedy that allows one to confront the most perilous fate.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_12":"The Omniguardian watches Arthur's back, remembering when he too faced the abyss with a similar resolve.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_13":"Times have changed.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_14":"You're right. The burden of this entire world should not rest on one person's shoulders.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_15":"Bastet says loudly to Arthur.","dialogue_season6_10115_1_16":"Noble king, let us help you achieve this grand ambition and return home in glory!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_1":"The sound of hooves shatters the silence, and three figures appear on the horizon, galloping forward.","dialogue_season6_10201_1_2":"Faster. We must go faster!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_3":"We haven't closed our eyes for three days, and you're only human. Don't push yourself to the limit!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_4":"For every minute I crave rest, my people endure another minute of freezing cold.","dialogue_season6_10201_1_5":"We're almost there. Soon, we will reach the seven gates of the underworld...","dialogue_season6_10201_1_6":"No... do not let fear change your hearts!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_7":"Are there others here?","dialogue_season6_10201_1_8":"Don't forget, the Mother of Earth always watches over the souls of her faithful. Through faith, we will be blessed!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_9":"Hehe...","dialogue_season6_10201_1_10":"Monsters, clear the way!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_11":"Ahead lies the sacred Gate of Vitality. The Mother of Earth will not turn a blind eye to your atrocities!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_12":"Gahaha!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_13":"Claws slash through the air, and an old woman screams in terror.","dialogue_season6_10201_1_14":"Blood, blood... the blood won't stop...!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_15":"Impossible... this must be an illusion... We cannot fall outside the... new world...","dialogue_season6_10201_1_16":"Roar!!","dialogue_season6_10201_1_17":"Grab your weapons; someone needs help!","dialogue_season6_10201_2_1":"Ugh...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_2":"After a fierce battle, King Arthur wavers, nearly collapsing.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_3":"Your body has reached its limit.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_4":"We don't have time...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_5":"What he needs isn't rest; the Mother of Earth's blessing awaits him ahead...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_6":"The old woman they had saved struggles to sit up.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_7":"Who are you?","dialogue_season6_10201_2_8":"We... we are followers of the Earth Goddess, Gaia...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_9":"You're not here in this desolate place for sightseeing, are you?","dialogue_season6_10201_2_10":"We're seeking... the miracle of Goddess Gaia...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_11":"I've met missionaries before. They usually travel in small groups, but your companions...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_12":"Arthur looks up, warily eyeing the crowd that has gathered around the old woman.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_13":"There's quite a number of them.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_14":"The kingdom has been ravaged by disaster. We took in many refugees during our journey.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_15":"That seems true. Look closely at their clothes and expressions.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_16":"Only a few are dressed as missionaries, while the rest are ragged, frightened refugees.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_17":"Our homes were swallowed by the blizzards...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_18":"Please... show mercy. We just want to rebuild our lives in a warm place...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_19":"In a dream, the Goddess entrusted me with these people, who have suffered so much in the cold...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_20":"You've done well. It's my failure that led them to this suffering.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_21":"Following the Goddess's teachings, we journey toward the Gate of Vitality, where a paradise of eternal spring awaits...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_22":"A new world without blizzards?","dialogue_season6_10201_2_23":"The old woman coughs violently, her gaze drifting toward something behind Arthur.","dialogue_season6_10201_2_24":"I... I see the radiance of Goddess Gaia...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_25":"Please... open the door to the new world for sinners like us...","dialogue_season6_10201_2_26":"A look of relief washes over her face, as her pupils lose focus.","dialogue_season6_10205_1_1":"A look of relief washes over her face, as her pupils lose focus.","dialogue_season6_10205_1_2":"She's dead...","dialogue_season6_10205_1_3":"The Earth Goddess and the Gate of Vitality... This is an important clue.","dialogue_season6_10205_1_4":"We should take up her duty and guide these unarmed people into the new world.","dialogue_season6_10205_1_5":"That means we'll have to postpone our journey to the underworld.","dialogue_season6_10205_1_6":"Hmm...","dialogue_season6_10205_1_7":"The new world may be the better choice.","dialogue_season6_10205_2_1":"The invincible ruler, King Arthur of Camelot...","dialogue_season6_10205_2_2":"I am the new life you've been seeking, the Earth Goddess Gaia.","dialogue_season6_10205_2_3":"Gaia points forward. A towering, majestic gate, nearly touching the sky, slowly materializes before everyone.","dialogue_season6_10205_2_4":"The Goddess... the Goddess has descended!","dialogue_season6_10205_2_5":"It's a divine miracle!","dialogue_season6_10205_2_6":"The Gate of Vitality, the passage to the new world, has opened for you.","dialogue_season6_10205_2_7":"In the vibrant garden, a new kingdom will be built.","dialogue_season6_10205_2_8":"The leader was right. With unwavering faith, we can reach the new world...","dialogue_season6_10205_2_9":"I've had enough of this endless winter! Move aside. I'm going in first!","dialogue_season6_10205_2_10":"Heh heh!!","dialogue_season6_10205_2_11":"People rush toward the Gate of Vitality, while the snow monsters stand in their way, jaws wide open, ready to snatch those who fall behind.","dialogue_season6_10205_2_12":"We have to protect them from those monsters!","dialogue_season6_10205_3_1":"A woman's intuition tells me something's not right.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_2":"Do you smell that?","dialogue_season6_10205_3_3":"Ah... has a flower of winter just bloomed?","dialogue_season6_10205_3_4":"It's the frost lily, the flower of the underworld.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_5":"Legend has it that its scent makes one forget yesterday, today, and tomorrow—until eternity.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_6":"Why would the Flower of the Underworld bloom in the world of the living?","dialogue_season6_10205_3_7":"Something must have gone wrong...","dialogue_season6_10205_3_8":"Foolish, gullible, fragile humans.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_9":"You cannot survive in a world without gods.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_10":"You're the woman who attacked the messenger outside the city!","dialogue_season6_10205_3_11":"Step back, mortal.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_12":"You should fear this mind-consuming cold.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_13":"I follow the knight's code, never retreating even in the face of death. But you...","dialogue_season6_10205_3_14":"You are the goddess who once brought spring, Lady Elisha.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_15":"So, you haven't forgotten.","dialogue_season6_10205_3_16":"I can bring spring, but I am also the goddess who shelters the dead.","dialogue_season6_10210_1_1":"Step aside.

My underworld has no place for the lies of the Demon Gaia.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_3":"Lies?","dialogue_season6_10305_1_4":"She made me a promise that good things would happen every day.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_5":"She said she'd bring spring and a bountiful harvest to the world...","dialogue_season6_10305_1_6":"But the cold winds never stopped.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_7":"Those human souls were eroded by the frost for too long. Not even the frost lilies could make them forget their fear of death.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_8":"So... I came to the surface. Only through slaughter can I grant those souls peace.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_9":"I've said enough.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_10":"The wind quiets for a moment, revealing the sound of snow monsters moving.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_11":"This is bad. We're surrounded by snow monsters!","dialogue_season6_10305_1_12":"She's been distracting us the whole time—to trap us!","dialogue_season6_10305_1_13":"If you truly care about the survival of humanity, don't interfere with my actions.","dialogue_season6_10305_1_14":"Rawwwrrrr!","dialogue_season6_10310_1_1":"Elisha stands atop the snowy ridge, gazing down at the defenseless Camelot.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_2":"This is humanity's last line of defense, a city abandoned by its king.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_3":"Come with me, and I will cherish you as treasures.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_4":"This place is filled with the souls of the departed.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_5":"Stop!","dialogue_season6_10310_1_6":"In the moment before the avalanche rushes toward Camelot, Diao Chan's music becomes the final force to oppose it.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_7":"Don't you understand?","dialogue_season6_10310_1_8":"Struggling hopelessly to survive like this only prevents their souls from finding peace after death.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_9":"Everything I do is to help them escape this prison.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_10":"In a safe and secure afterlife, all worries born of survival will fade away with life itself.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_11":"We do not have to choose death.","dialogue_season6_10310_1_12":"...","dialogue_season6_10310_1_13":"You can't stop me.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_1":"Why are you so stubborn? Can't you see the reality?","dialogue_season6_10315_1_2":"Only death will set them free.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_3":"Enough... You shouldn't talk so lightly about others' life and death.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_4":"I've seen empires under tyrannical rule, and I've thought about using force to save a nation...","dialogue_season6_10315_1_5":"But we didn't resort to violence.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_6":"The people have suffered enough. If the country falls into chaos, who knows how many more will lose their families.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_7":"I want those I care about to live with dignity in a peaceful land.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_8":"Isn't that something worth striving for?","dialogue_season6_10315_1_9":"...","dialogue_season6_10315_1_10":"If you truly care for humanity, you should address the root of the problem.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_11":"Gaia...","dialogue_season6_10315_1_12":"Gaia may make mistakes, but she will always have the right to make them.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_13":"Because she is not only the mother of humanity, but the mother of all gods.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_14":"When she is angry, mortals can only submit and pray that her wrath will be soothed.","dialogue_season6_10315_1_15":"You should abandon the thought of overturning the order.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_1":"Impossible...","dialogue_season6_10315_2_2":"I am the ruler of the underworld... the master of the dead... an immortal goddess...","dialogue_season6_10315_2_3":"How could I be defeated by humans...?","dialogue_season6_10315_2_4":"You only know that gods can be angry, that gods have the dignity to choose their own path.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_5":"You only know that gods laugh at us, as we struggle against the eternal with our fragile bodies.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_6":"But did you know that we, too, can feel anger?","dialogue_season6_10315_2_7":"On my journey, I've witnessed too much misfortune.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_8":"How many homes have been crushed by snow? How many families have lost their last source of livelihood?","dialogue_season6_10315_2_9":"We are living beings too, with blood and flesh.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_10":"Humans shouldn't have thoughts like this...","dialogue_season6_10315_2_11":"You are too strong.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_12":"Your physical strength has made you mentally weak, allowing you to see only the suffering before you.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_13":"But humanity's weakness forces us to carry more as we move forward, making us mentally stronger.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_14":"Elisha, it's time for you to choose.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_15":"Gaia is my kin. I shouldn't oppose her...","dialogue_season6_10315_2_16":"She is abusing her power, slaughtering the weak.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_17":"Make your choice. Don't let it be one you'll regret.","dialogue_season6_10315_2_18":"...","dialogue_season6_10315_2_19":"My choice is...","dialogue_season6_10401_1_1":"In Gaia's new world, Arthur and Bastet are still fighting with all they have.","dialogue_season6_10401_1_2":"Normally, the enemies my knights and I face are either humans or snow monsters.","dialogue_season6_10401_1_3":"They are reasonable opponents. I can just incapacitate them temporarily... or use a bit more force if needed.","dialogue_season6_10401_1_4":"But these monsters in front of us have no heads, no limbs...","dialogue_season6_10401_1_5":"Stop overthinking it. Just aim for the disgusting parts first.","dialogue_season6_10401_1_6":"Struggle all you want... In the end, you'll rest like infants beneath the soil, becoming nutrients for the new world.","dialogue_season6_10401_1_7":"I will never surrender to a venomous witch like you!","dialogue_season6_10401_1_8":"I've been more than tolerant, yet you remain so ungrateful.","dialogue_season6_10401_1_9":"My children, wave your vines and teach these primitives some manners!","dialogue_season6_10401_2_1":"The weight on my shoulders makes it hard to breathe. Perhaps in the next moment, I won't be able to lift my sword anymore.","dialogue_season6_10401_2_2":"The refugees sheltered behind them let out terrified cries.","dialogue_season6_10401_2_3":"No... I made a wrong decision. I must shoulder this responsibility and turn the tide.","dialogue_season6_10401_2_4":"Even if it means charging at those vile monsters and perishing together, even if this battle holds no honor!","dialogue_season6_10401_2_5":"Don't be so pessimistic. I believe the Omniguardian is out there seeking help for us.","dialogue_season6_10401_2_6":"Think of your country, your people... Yes, we are destined to face death, but it can't be at this moment!","dialogue_season6_10401_2_7":"Let us regain our confidence; strength will surge from our determined hearts!","dialogue_season6_10401_2_8":"Thank you for your encouragement. My arms seem to feel a bit stronger.","dialogue_season6_10401_2_9":"My life is not yet extinguished. Let's continue to fight!","dialogue_season6_10405_1_1":"What a resilient life force. This is precisely the nourishment I need.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_2":"Perhaps we don't have to be enemies. Maybe... I can allow you to live.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_3":"In Gaia's hand, her most cherished Relic appears—the Vanquisher.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_4":"All I need to do is sever your wings and trim away the pestilence clinging to your souls...","dialogue_season6_10405_1_5":"Then you can transform into new beings, guardians of the new world.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_6":"How wonderful it is! Indulge in my boundless creativity! Huh?","dialogue_season6_10405_1_7":"Gaia pauses, turning her gaze toward the Gate of Vitality.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_8":"On the snow-covered plains of the old world, two familiar figures suddenly appear: the Omniguardian and Diao Chan.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_9":"Evil woman, we're back!","dialogue_season6_10405_1_10":"You should call me \"Mother.\"","dialogue_season6_10405_1_11":"How disgusting.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_12":"You can't escape the gaze of the gods. Since your end is near, you might as well enjoy a sweet slumber in my embrace.","dialogue_season6_10405_1_13":"Then why don't you make a move? Are you afraid?","dialogue_season6_10405_1_14":"You...","dialogue_season6_10405_1_15":"In that case, we'll strike first! Let me unlock your Gate of Vitality with my music!","dialogue_season6_10405_1_16":"You choose death willingly, so become decay and serve as my soil!","dialogue_season6_10405_2_1":"I hear it... The Omniguardian is calling for me! He has returned with reinforcements!","dialogue_season6_10405_2_2":"Is he attacking the Gate of Vitality?","dialogue_season6_10405_2_3":"Yes, we need to coordinate our actions and launch an attack on the Gate of Vitality together.","dialogue_season6_10405_2_4":"Come on, raise those aching arms once more. This time, victory awaits us ahead!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_1":"The final blow! The music lands!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_2":"We did it! The gate is open!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_3":"The Gate of Vitality sways, reconnecting the old and new worlds.","dialogue_season6_10410_1_4":"Omniguardian, you truly did it!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_5":"Quick, everyone, return to our world at once!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_6":"We are saved. We are saved!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_7":"Hurry up! I can't stay in this wretched new world for a second longer!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_8":"This is impossible...","dialogue_season6_10410_1_9":"How can mortal strength harm the creations of the gods...","dialogue_season6_10410_1_10":"As Gaia's incredible whispers fill the air, people rush toward the other side of the gate.","dialogue_season6_10410_1_11":"Stay... Obey the commands of the gods! Everyone stay back!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_12":"Elisha, now is the time!","dialogue_season6_10410_1_13":"I can't believe this...","dialogue_season6_10415_1_1":"What a precise strike, Elisha!","dialogue_season6_10415_1_2":"Incredible mortals, witness my choice, my answer.","dialogue_season6_10415_1_3":"Elisha... how dare you raise your weapon against the Mother of Gods? Have you been swayed by those mortals?","dialogue_season6_10415_1_4":"You are the one deceiving me. I have seen the truth; darkness will no longer blind my eyes.","dialogue_season6_10415_1_5":"Then go ahead and give it a try. The one who wins in the end will still be me.","dialogue_season6_10415_1_6":"Elisha, you still have us.","dialogue_season6_10415_1_7":"My sword will tear apart the night before dawn!","dialogue_season6_10415_1_8":"Don't worry. My music will keep you alert!","dialogue_season6_10415_1_9":"As you wish, the epic battle between the Mother of Earth and the Ruler of the Underworld begins now.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_1":"You cannot—are not allowed—to escape from my grasp!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_2":"Everyone, strike together!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_3":"No!!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_4":"With everyone working together, Gaia is pushed back into the new world.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_5":"The Gate of Vitality slowly closes, sealing her malicious curse behind it.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_6":"Among my noble kin, there is a traitor…!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_7":"I will always, always, always watch you from another world…","dialogue_season6_10415_2_8":"Chaos and destruction… Misfortune will not overlook your smallest mistakes…","dialogue_season6_10415_2_9":"Boom! The Gate of Vitality collapses completely, banishing Gaia for good.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_10":"We did it…!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_11":"Evil has been expelled, and we have defended our land!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_12":"This is a feat that moves heaven and earth, mortals. This victory crowns your courage.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_13":"But the crisis is not over yet; you must not let your guard down.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_14":"You all heard her curse before she departed; the safety of the world depends on your protection.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_15":"Let her come for me; I won't let her harm my people.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_16":"If the living are taken by Gaia, my underworld will lose its meaning.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_17":"I will watch over this world with them.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_18":"And I. After the hard-fought battle, you need a triumphant song to lift your spirits.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_19":"I've never tried the entertainment of the living before.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_20":"Life always offers countless firsts—even for the gods.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_21":"If you'd like, I can teach you to play—after you release those trapped souls from the soul lantern.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_22":"They are now free. But… I think I'll pass on your offer.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_23":"Why? It's these vivid experiences that fill us with passion for life!","dialogue_season6_10415_2_24":"Let's go; it's time to return.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_25":"The ice and snow have melted, and those who have been away for so long ascend the hill, witnessing the spring all around.","dialogue_season6_10415_2_26":"In the distance, the banners of Camelot flutter. The guards blow their horns to welcome their heroes home!","dialogue_season7_10100_1_01":"Omniguardian, with you stationed in Mirlond, the Abyss dares not invade.","dialogue_season7_10100_1_02":"Yet it has not gone away; it still lurks, constantly coveting Itheron.","dialogue_season7_10100_1_03":"Our observations reveal that this time, it has corrupted an entire oceanic region of Itheron.","dialogue_season7_10100_1_04":"Listen, the ocean's wail echoes across time and space, crying out to us for help.","dialogue_season7_10100_1_05":"Let's go, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season7_10100_1_06":"Open the Eternal Gate, and let us embark on a new journey!","dialogue_season7_10101_1_01":"Moon, oh Moon...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_02":"I swear, as the Goddess of the Underworld Moon, to pour all my strength into you.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_03":"I hope you will protect the Moonlit Netherrealm and its people...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_04":"...Then, the great change that swept across the continent caused the goddess to fall into slumber.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_05":"Her kingdom perished, and the moon sank into the sea.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_06":"Until another goddess awakened it.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_07":"Moon, oh Moon...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_08":"I grant you the power of the people's prayers, my sincere plea...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_09":"I hope you will cast your moonlight to illuminate the dark seabed and protect these poor people.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_10":"The world changes with time...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_11":"It seems only the moon remains as it once was...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_12":"Omniguardian, wake up!!","dialogue_season7_10101_1_13":"A sharp light falls, and the focused, urgent face of a young woman appears before the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_14":"Marina...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_15":"Whew, you scared me! You collapsed as soon as we arrived in these waters...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_16":"I just saw the moon's memories...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_17":"The moon!? Memories!? It can't be...","dialogue_season7_10101_1_18":"Omniguardian, the moon isn't human. How could it have memories?!","dialogue_season7_10101_1_19":"Rawwwrrrr!","dialogue_season7_10101_1_20":"Ugh, here they come again! These monsters just won't leave us alone.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_21":"Did they attack us while I was unconscious?","dialogue_season7_10101_1_22":"Marina, thank you for protecting me.","dialogue_season7_10101_1_23":"Don't mention it. Let me handle these monsters!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_01":"Haha, did you see those monsters fleeing in panic? We're awesome!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_02":"How about it? I'm no worse than the other Valkyries, am I?","dialogue_season7_10105_1_03":"Omniguardian, I've grown stronger now! I will protect you!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_04":"Marina, you've become so powerful!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_05":"Marina, you're really cute...","dialogue_season7_10105_1_06":"(blushing) Really? You better not be lying to me!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_07":"Help... help me!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_08":"Omniguardian, it seems like someone is calling for help from the depths of the darkness.","dialogue_season7_10105_1_09":"Is there any hero out there who will save a helpless beauty like me?","dialogue_season7_10105_1_10":"Oh no, that girl is surrounded by monsters!","dialogue_season7_10105_1_11":"Omniguardian, let's go help her!","dialogue_season7_10110_1_01":"Thank you, my hero!","dialogue_season7_10110_1_02":"The woman who was saved hugs the Omniguardian and places a deep kiss on his cheek.","dialogue_season7_10110_1_03":"Hey! You... you!","dialogue_season7_10110_1_04":"Don't be mad, Miss Mermaid. This sincere kiss of mine...","dialogue_season7_10110_1_05":"It was just to repay the hero for saving my life.","dialogue_season7_10110_1_06":"Hug Pandora?","dialogue_season7_10110_1_07":"Push Pandora away?","dialogue_season7_10110_1_08":"Ah, you're such a flirt! Miss Mermaid is still right here.","dialogue_season7_10110_1_09":"Hehe, you're shy...","dialogue_season7_10110_1_10":"I'm Pandora. I'll be leaving now. Hope to see you both again next time.","dialogue_season7_10110_1_11":"You crazy woman... don't leave just yet!","dialogue_season7_10110_1_12":"Hiss...","dialogue_season7_10110_1_13":"Ah! Help! I'm surrounded again!","dialogue_season7_10110_2_01":"...","dialogue_season7_10110_2_02":"...","dialogue_season7_10110_2_03":"Why are you looking at me like that? Do you want my kiss, too?","dialogue_season7_10110_2_04":"Nonsense. Who wants your kiss? You... you! You're so weird!","dialogue_season7_10110_2_05":"Hehe. Sorry, living in this polluted sea... anyone would go mad!","dialogue_season7_10110_2_06":"Polluted? By the Abyss?","dialogue_season7_10110_2_07":"Yes, the corruption from the Abyss has obscured the moonlight beneath the sea.","dialogue_season7_10110_2_08":"All that's left above the surface is endless darkness. This place has almost turned into a hell on Earth.","dialogue_season7_10110_2_09":"Moonlight beneath the sea? What a strange image.","dialogue_season7_10110_2_10":"However, it seems the Abyss's corruption is right under the sea...","dialogue_season7_10110_2_11":"Omniguardian, to solve the problem in this area, we need to dive into the depths!","dialogue_season7_10110_2_12":"You want to go to the seabed? Great, take me with you!","dialogue_season7_10110_2_13":"Take you?","dialogue_season7_10110_2_14":"Stop looking at me like that. I can guide you!","dialogue_season7_10110_2_15":"Don't try to pull a fast one. Why the sudden change of heart?","dialogue_season7_10110_2_16":"Alright, I'll be honest. My treasure fell into the sea.","dialogue_season7_10110_2_17":"I need to get it back to survive in this dangerous world.","dialogue_season7_10110_2_18":"Sounds too suspicious... but leaving you behind doesn't feel right...","dialogue_season7_10110_2_19":"Omniguardian, should we bring her along?","dialogue_season7_10110_2_20":"...","dialogue_season7_10110_2_21":"As long as it doesn't interfere with our mission","dialogue_season7_10110_2_22":"Don't worry, I'll behave. I won't cause any trouble.","dialogue_season7_10110_2_23":"Alright... then let's head to the depths!","dialogue_season7_10114_1_01":"The seawater at the seabed feels so uncomfortable... I'm afraid the Abyss has completely polluted the depths...","dialogue_season7_10114_1_02":"Omniguardian! If we'd arrived any later... I'm afraid...","dialogue_season7_10114_1_03":"Look, what's that glowing over there?","dialogue_season7_10114_1_04":"In the depths of the darkness, there still exists a gentle glow.","dialogue_season7_10114_1_05":"Let's get closer and take a look","dialogue_season7_10114_1_06":"The three of them walk toward the light, discovering a massive white jade pearl emitting a faint glow.","dialogue_season7_10114_1_07":"Is this... an unbelievably huge pearl?","dialogue_season7_10114_1_08":"No, this is the moon...","dialogue_season7_10114_1_09":"The moon... by the hand of fate, I finally meet you...","dialogue_season7_10114_1_10":"The moon... such a beautiful thing truly exists in this world.","dialogue_season7_10114_1_11":"But just gazing from afar isn't enough...","dialogue_season7_10114_1_12":"Pandora walks toward the moon, entranced, reaching out to touch that pure, white moon.","dialogue_season7_10114_1_13":"Who dares to tarnish the sacred light of the moon!","dialogue_season7_10115_1_01":"No trace of moonlight. Aren't you from Moonlight City?","dialogue_season7_10115_1_02":"Moonlight City? What's that place?","dialogue_season7_10115_1_03":"We came from above the sea, here to cleanse the Abyss's corruption!","dialogue_season7_10115_1_04":"The moon... the moon...","dialogue_season7_10201_1_01":"What exactly are you here for?","dialogue_season7_10201_1_02":"We really came to cleanse the corruption!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_03":"Hah, such noble words.","dialogue_season7_10201_1_04":"If you had no desire for the moon, I wouldn't have been awakened.","dialogue_season7_10201_1_05":"This moon is Moonlight City's last defense against the Abyss...","dialogue_season7_10201_1_06":"If we lose it, the Abyss's corruption in the depths of the sea will be unstoppable!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_07":"Stay away from the moon! If you don't, I'll risk my life to...","dialogue_season7_10201_1_08":"I told you, we're not here for the moon!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_09":"Hehe, but I am here for the moon!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_10":"This perfect, flawless moon should belong to me!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_11":"Pandora's voice sharpens, and her entire being emanates a strange, unsettling aura.","dialogue_season7_10201_1_12":"To obtain it, even if it means bringing disaster to the world, what is there to fear?!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_13":"Pandora, you?!","dialogue_season7_10201_1_14":"You want to stop me?! Are you also coveting the moon?","dialogue_season7_10201_1_15":"The moon is mine! Get out of my way!!","dialogue_season7_10205_1_01":"Moon, oh Moon...","dialogue_season7_10205_1_02":"My appearance is so flawless, yet my soul is so empty.","dialogue_season7_10205_1_03":"Only... only by possessing you, using your perfect light to fill my soul...","dialogue_season7_10205_1_04":"Can I become the most perfect person in the world!","dialogue_season7_10205_1_05":"You're crazy! What you're saying is getting more and more insane!","dialogue_season7_10205_1_06":"This power? It's the Abyss...","dialogue_season7_10205_1_07":"I'm afraid she was already corrupted from the start.","dialogue_season7_10205_1_08":"So stubborn... Cough! cough!","dialogue_season7_10205_1_09":"Thankfully, I wasn't too late.","dialogue_season7_10205_1_10":"A faint, delicate fragrance wafts in, as a woman, with the grace of laurel, stands between Pandora and the moon.","dialogue_season7_10205_1_11":"Chang'e...","dialogue_season7_10205_1_12":"Leave this to me.","dialogue_season7_10205_1_13":"Once, the moon protected us from the Abyss's corruption.","dialogue_season7_10205_1_14":"Now, it is our turn to protect the moon.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_01":"Omniguardian, has Pandora truly been corrupted by the Abyss?","dialogue_season7_10205_2_02":"She seemed perfectly normal earlier...","dialogue_season7_10205_2_03":"Hmm, well, maybe not \"normal\" in the traditional sense...","dialogue_season7_10205_2_04":"You two, the beautiful girl traveling with you...","dialogue_season7_10205_2_05":"I fear that the moon has awakened her desires, pulling her into the abyss of longing.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_06":"The moon is our treasure, a miraculous thing that manifested in response to the prayers of the ancestors of Moonlight City.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_07":"It carries the hopes and dreams of humanity in Moonlight City for thousands of years, radiating a pure and supreme light.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_08":"However, in the fight against the Abyss, this accumulated wish was tainted, slowly transforming into desire.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_09":"Even I have once fallen prey to the longing for the moon.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_10":"Chang'e... I'm grateful to you. I didn't expect you to return to the moon's side.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_11":"It seems that you can now resist the temptation of the moonlight.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_12":"Please, don't say that.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_13":"As the Lord of Moonlight City, I still have the deepest longing for the moon.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_14":"This desire cannot withstand the test. For the people of Moonlight City, I must stay away from the moon.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_15":"It's time for me to leave. You two guests, come with me to Moonlight City.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_16":"Moonlight City... Is it a city beneath the sea? It reminds me of my homeland.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_17":"Though Moonlight City is beneath the sea, it is not part of the ocean.","dialogue_season7_10205_2_18":"Eh?! That sounds so interesting!","dialogue_season7_10205_2_19":"Omniguardian, let's set out!","dialogue_season7_10210_1_01":"The group passes through the underwater light barrier and descends into Moonlight City, a place as beautiful as a fairyland.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_02":"Look, what a bustling and beautiful city this is!","dialogue_season7_10210_1_03":"The moon hangs high, and the ocean has turned into the sky!","dialogue_season7_10210_1_04":"It is this bright moon that protects Moonlight City, helping us drive back the Abyss's corruption.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_05":"But the Abyss's corruption continues to grow stronger...","dialogue_season7_10210_1_06":"In order to protect the moon...","dialogue_season7_10210_1_07":"Chang'e's gaze lingers on Marina for a moment before finally turning to the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_08":"I wish to form a pact with you and gain power similar to Miss Marina's.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_09":"Huh?! But a Valkyrie Pact can only be made with someone closely connected to the Omniguardian...","dialogue_season7_10210_1_10":"I'm tempted...","dialogue_season7_10210_1_11":"Marina...","dialogue_season7_10210_1_12":"Omniguardian, you... you!","dialogue_season7_10210_1_13":"Hmph, if you like her, I'll just step aside!","dialogue_season7_10210_1_14":"Marina, blushing, walks away.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_15":"I apologize for the trouble I caused. I'll explain things to Miss Marina later.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_16":"But the situation is urgent, and for the sake of the moon, I must rely on your power.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_17":"Before Chang'e finishes speaking, the ground suddenly shakes violently! Darkness presses down on Moonlight City without warning.","dialogue_season7_10210_1_18":"How could this be? The moon... is gone!","dialogue_season7_10210_1_19":"Bai Suzhen has encountered trouble! Let's go!","dialogue_season7_10215_1_01":"Rawwwrrrr!","dialogue_season7_10215_1_02":"Cough... I will cut down every one of the Abyss's minions...","dialogue_season7_10215_1_03":"Bai Suzhen is wounded, yet she grows fiercer with every strike.","dialogue_season7_10215_1_04":"I'd rather die in battle than... fail to reclaim the moon!","dialogue_season7_10215_1_05":"Suzhen, we're here to help!","dialogue_season7_10215_1_06":"Be careful, this monster is extremely powerful. We must proceed with caution!","dialogue_season7_10215_2_01":"You've taken severe wounds... Who did this to you?","dialogue_season7_10215_2_02":"It was Pandora. She opened a strange magic box...","dialogue_season7_10215_2_03":"A powerful force from the Abyss surged out of the box, knocking me unconscious...","dialogue_season7_10215_2_04":"When I awoke...","dialogue_season7_10215_2_05":"The moon had been stolen, and the Abyss's minions began to emerge...","dialogue_season7_10301_1_01":"The seabed plunges into darkness after the moon is lost, allowing Abyss monsters to rampage freely.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_02":"The scent of life... It's so sweet...","dialogue_season7_10301_1_03":"These minions only dare to skulk in the shadows of the dark.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_04":"Everyone, don't worry. I have cherished the moonlight of millennia within me.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_05":"Tonight, I shall become the moon and illuminate the night sky!","dialogue_season7_10301_1_06":"Chang'e sends a laurel tree soaring into the air, casting moonlight to brighten Moonlight City.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_07":"(Surprised) Light!","dialogue_season7_10301_1_08":"A feeble light cannot stop the flood of the Abyss.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_09":"Hmph, there are even more monsters than I expected.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_10":"Very well. I'll use you to hone my twin blades!","dialogue_season7_10301_1_11":"Make it quick. We must find Pandora as soon as possible to turn the tide.","dialogue_season7_10301_1_12":"You think such faint light can stop the mighty us?","dialogue_season7_10301_1_13":"Laughable!","dialogue_season7_10301_1_14":"Get out of my way!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_01":"The deeper they go, the more densely packed the Abyss monsters become.","dialogue_season7_10305_1_02":"Ugh!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_03":"Suzhen, fall back for now. Let me handle them.","dialogue_season7_10305_1_04":"It's just a scratch, nothing worth mentioning.","dialogue_season7_10305_1_05":"Look, that thief who stole the moon is just ahead!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_06":"The moon... my moon...!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_07":"Neither Moonlight City nor the Abyss truly cares about you. They only want to use you...","dialogue_season7_10305_1_08":"But I won't let anyone take you away!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_09":"Oh, moon, my moon... let us become one!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_10":"Pandora!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_11":"I didn't expect you to catch up so quickly.","dialogue_season7_10305_1_12":"My hero, are you here to bully me and the moon too?","dialogue_season7_10305_1_13":"Says the thief who stole the moon! How can you be so shamelessly self-righteous?","dialogue_season7_10305_1_14":"The moon... it doesn't want to stay with you, nor does it wish to shine on Moonlight City.","dialogue_season7_10305_1_15":"You imprisoned it for thousands of years. You are the real thieves!","dialogue_season7_10305_1_16":"Don't waste words on this madwoman. Let's take her down first!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_01":"No, my moon!!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_02":"Pandora collapses, and her magic box cracks open slightly.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_03":"Moonlight spills forth, bathing Chang'e in its glow.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_04":"Oh no... it's the moonlight!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_05":"Wonderful! It's the moonlight!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_06":"Chang'e's eyes gleam with a new and unfamiliar light.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_07":"I see it... the moonlight's guidance.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_08":"A beautiful future that everyone has longed for.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_09":"The struggles and hardships we've overcome were all for this moment.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_10":"To reclaim the moon, not for us, but for me... for me alone.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_11":"Suddenly, Chang'e turns against the group, launching an attack.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_12":"Taking advantage of the chaos, Pandora escapes into the distance with the moon still within the box.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_13":"!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_14":"What... what have I done?","dialogue_season7_10305_2_15":"Tears of regret stream down her cheeks.","dialogue_season7_10305_2_16":"Don't blame yourself; the moonlight is the problem!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_17":"It's fine; we can still fix this!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_18":"Chang'e, snap out of it... We need to go after her!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_19":"(Chang'e only falters for a moment before regaining her composure.)","dialogue_season7_10305_2_20":"Yes, I am the ruler of Moonlight City, and I have people to protect!","dialogue_season7_10305_2_21":"I will deal with these monsters!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_01":"Chang'e's magic is nearly depleted, and the glow of the moonlit laurel dims.","dialogue_season7_10310_1_02":"While I can still hold on, you must go now!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_03":"If not for my earlier mistake, this chance wouldn't have slipped through our fingers…","dialogue_season7_10310_1_04":"Let me atone with my actions!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_05":"Chang'e...","dialogue_season7_10310_1_06":"Chang'e... I'm not leaving anyone behind!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_07":"Hmph, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_08":"Sweet words again? Seems I've arrived at the wrong moment!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_09":"Marina!!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_10":"You're finally back!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_11":"Alright, alright. I saw everything earlier. You did nothing wrong!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_12":"Helping everyone in need is exactly why I admire you so much, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_13":"I brought back someone to help. She's agreed to aid us in reclaiming the moon!","dialogue_season7_10310_1_14":"Golden-red flames dance down from the ocean's surface, their mysterious power forcing back the Abyss's minions.","dialogue_season7_10310_1_15":"You must be the Omniguardian Marina holds in such high regard.","dialogue_season7_10310_1_16":"And you are?","dialogue_season7_10310_1_17":"A woman descends gracefully, her lithe figure wrapped in a veil of shadowy silk.","dialogue_season7_10310_1_18":"I am Hecate, Goddess of the Underworld Moon.","dialogue_season7_10310_1_19":"And I will change the fate of your failure.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_01":"It's hard to imagine that someone as weak as you once dared lay a hand on my moon.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_02":"Your moon?","dialogue_season7_10315_1_03":"The moon is a symbol of my power. It once illuminated my kingdom.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_04":"But the upheaval in Itheron cast me into a long slumber.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_05":"Now, I have awakened.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_06":"And I will reclaim my moon.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_07":"Hecate points her torch directly at Chang'e.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_08":"Stand down!","dialogue_season7_10315_1_09":"A feeble moon goddess like you has no place aiding in the moon's recovery!","dialogue_season7_10315_1_10":"As the ruler of Moonlight City, I cannot accept your demand!","dialogue_season7_10315_1_11":"I have shared a millennium with the moon. I will reclaim it myself.","dialogue_season7_10315_1_12":"It seems I'll have to make you see reason with strength!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_01":"Stop, both of you! Reclaiming the moon is our top priority!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_02":"Stop it!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_03":"Enough!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_04":"I alone am enough to retrieve the moon.","dialogue_season7_10315_2_05":"Wait, something's rumbling in the distance!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_06":"A thunderous crash reverberates through the seabed, like massive stones shattering.","dialogue_season7_10315_2_07":"Look toward Moonlight City!!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_08":"What is that?!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_09":"A tide of Abyss monsters, dark as ink, surges toward Moonlight City!","dialogue_season7_10315_2_10":"This is bad. We need to move, now!","dialogue_season7_10401_1_01":"The moon spills out waves of black mist, coalescing into a massive fog gate.","dialogue_season7_10401_1_02":"From within the gate, endless minions pour forth...","dialogue_season7_10401_1_03":"No!","dialogue_season7_10401_1_04":"The moon! Come down... come to me!","dialogue_season7_10401_1_05":"The moon seems to have undergone some kind of transformation.","dialogue_season7_10401_1_06":"It's been completely corrupted by the Abyss...","dialogue_season7_10401_1_07":"Now it's become the energy core of the Abyss portal.","dialogue_season7_10401_1_08":"It seems we'll have to shatter that black mist to sever the Abyss and save the moon.","dialogue_season7_10401_1_09":"Let me handle this. We must end this quickly.","dialogue_season7_10405_1_01":"Stay close, everyone. Don't get separated!","dialogue_season7_10405_1_02":"Damn it. More monsters are hiding in the darkness!","dialogue_season7_10405_1_03":"Leave them to me!","dialogue_season7_10405_1_04":"Chang'e's laurel transforms into a moon once again, rising to the sky and illuminating the darkness.","dialogue_season7_10405_1_05":"My moonlight won't fade away, even if it dims for a moment.","dialogue_season7_10405_1_06":"This moonlight...","dialogue_season7_10405_1_07":"Hecate, I don't care what you think.","dialogue_season7_10405_1_08":"Moonlight City has been protected by the moon for thousands of years. I will restore the moon to its original form.","dialogue_season7_10405_1_09":"Even if it costs me my life.","dialogue_season7_10405_1_10":"When that time comes, I hope you will protect the people of Moonlight City. They are the moon's most faithful followers…","dialogue_season7_10405_1_11":"Heh, your resolve to protect... it does resemble that of a true lunar deity.","dialogue_season7_10410_1_01":"Hecate, you're hurt.","dialogue_season7_10410_1_02":"It's nothing, just a scratch.","dialogue_season7_10410_1_03":"If this continues, things will only get worse.","dialogue_season7_10410_1_04":"Wait, something's happening. The black mist is trembling violently.","dialogue_season7_10410_1_05":"The trapped moon begins to glow faintly.","dialogue_season7_10410_1_06":"Do you hear it?","dialogue_season7_10410_1_07":"You can hear it too...","dialogue_season7_10410_1_08":"The moon has awakened. It remembers us...","dialogue_season7_10410_1_09":"It seems to be crying… Let's save it together!","dialogue_season7_10410_2_01":"The moon regains its luster and slowly ascends into the sky.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_02":"The moon... the moon has flown away...","dialogue_season7_10410_2_03":"I just wanted to be perfect. Why?","dialogue_season7_10410_2_04":"Why do you all have to force me?!","dialogue_season7_10410_2_05":"Pandora grips the key in her hand and opens the magic box.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_06":"Thick, evil black mist pours out, quickly taking the shape of a familiar figure.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_07":"Long time no see... my dear true self...","dialogue_season7_10410_2_08":"It seems the little troubles I left for you are enough to make you struggle.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_09":"Dark Omniguardian?","dialogue_season7_10410_2_10":"Pandora, my child... I will grant you the source of the Abyss's power.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_11":"This power will fill the gap in your soul.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_12":"Go wild. Let this world meet its end!","dialogue_season7_10410_2_13":"Let everything be freed in the darkness!","dialogue_season7_10410_2_14":"Power, such wonderful power... fills my soul.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_15":"I no longer feel incomplete, but whole.","dialogue_season7_10410_2_16":"What I truly wanted was never a soul, but power...","dialogue_season7_10414_1_01":"Interesting, truly interesting...","dialogue_season7_10414_1_02":"Your memories have long since faded, turning into a blank slate.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_03":"You are no longer the player, just a mere pawn.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_04":"Yet, you always manage to turn danger into opportunity, defeating enemies far stronger than yourself.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_05":"You don't think you're the player, do you?","dialogue_season7_10414_1_06":"What gives you this sense of superiority?","dialogue_season7_10414_1_07":"Are you trying to anger me?","dialogue_season7_10414_1_08":"That's a waste of effort. After gaining absolute power, I've long since discarded all emotions.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_09":"I am the pure embodiment of the Abyss, a symbol of supreme power...","dialogue_season7_10414_1_10":"Today, I will personally bring everything to an end.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_11":"Is that so? That's not for you to decide!","dialogue_season7_10414_1_12":"Omniguardian, the moon's condition is recovering.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_13":"Our strength has returned to its peak.","dialogue_season7_10414_1_14":"This time, let us take action.","dialogue_season7_10414_2_01":"Don't celebrate too soon...","dialogue_season7_10414_2_02":"This is just one of my clones. We'll meet again...","dialogue_season7_10414_2_03":"No matter how many times you come, you will never win!","dialogue_season7_10414_2_04":"Huh?!","dialogue_season7_10414_2_05":"Pandora's hand pierces through the Dark Omniguardian's body, gripping his heart.","dialogue_season7_10414_2_06":"Hehe, since you've already lost, why not give me your clone?","dialogue_season7_10414_2_07":"I want more power...","dialogue_season7_10414_2_08":"You!!!","dialogue_season7_10414_2_09":"Don't look at me like that... You were the one who allowed me to cause all this chaos.","dialogue_season7_10414_2_10":"Isn't betrayal by Pandora perfectly normal? What's so surprising about it?","dialogue_season7_10414_2_11":"Yeah, even I'm used to it!","dialogue_season7_10414_2_12":"Pandora's magic box emits a terrifying force, devouring the Dark Omniguardian's clone.","dialogue_season7_10414_2_13":"Next, I'll use your blood to paint the perfect conclusion.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_01":"Pandora kneels on the ground, extending her hands toward the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_02":"As expected, I can't win against you, Omniguardian...","dialogue_season7_10415_1_03":"So...","dialogue_season7_10415_1_04":"Pandora suddenly charges forward, embracing the Omniguardian and resting her head on his chest.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_05":"(Whispering in his ear) I surrender, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_06":"Hey, Pandora!","dialogue_season7_10415_1_07":"Our debt isn't settled yet!","dialogue_season7_10415_1_08":"I haven't forgotten the disaster you brought to Moonlight City.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_09":"I have my own score to settle with you, too!","dialogue_season7_10415_1_10":"Hug Pandora","dialogue_season7_10415_1_11":"Push Pandora away","dialogue_season7_10415_1_12":"(She looks at you with a teasing smile.)","dialogue_season7_10415_1_13":"Uh-oh, my hero! If I don't leave now, I'll never escape.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_14":"I'll go ahead, looking forward to meeting you all next time.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_15":"Pandora transforms into black smoke, disappearing from sight.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_16":"Ugh!","dialogue_season7_10415_1_17":"If she ever sets foot in the lands illuminated by the moon again, I will not spare her.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_18":"Forget about that for now, the moon is our top priority.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_19":"The moon slowly descends, landing in Hecate's hands.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_20":"The moon is so beautiful... Even I once made mistakes because of it.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_21":"The moon has always guarded the world.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_22":"During my long slumber, it gave so much for this world.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_23":"It banished the darkness for a thousand years, only to fall into the Abyss's shadow.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_24":"Now, I will cleanse the moon of its corruption and restore the pure moonlight.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_25":"I will lend you a hand as well.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_26":"Both goddesses pour all their divine power into the moon.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_27":"The moon slowly rises, reaching the point where Moonlight City meets the seabed.","dialogue_season7_10415_1_28":"An unprecedentedly bright moonlight illuminates the ocean and also shines upon Moonlight City.","dialogue_season8_10100_1_1":"Omniguardian, the sacred sakura has bloomed on the other side of the Eternal Gate.","dialogue_season8_10100_1_2":"Beneath the vibrant petals, the dark currents of the Abyss lie hidden.","dialogue_season8_10100_1_3":"Doom is about to descend upon that small island.","dialogue_season8_10100_1_4":"It's time to set off again, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season8_10100_1_5":"Please, take my hand, and let's step through the gate together.","dialogue_season8_10101_1_1":"What a beautiful island. The air itself carries the scent of cherry blossoms...","dialogue_season8_10101_1_2":"I recall the pitch-black depths of the sea...","dialogue_season8_10101_1_3":"I recall the frozen, desolate wasteland...","dialogue_season8_10101_1_4":"At last, we've come upon a place that feels normal.","dialogue_season8_10101_1_5":"Ugh! Just after I invented a new version of Arcane Thunder.","dialogue_season8_10101_1_6":"I was hoping to test its power on this trip.","dialogue_season8_10101_1_7":"But on this beautiful island, I have no idea where to find any monsters.","dialogue_season8_10101_1_8":"Watch out, both of you!","dialogue_season8_10101_1_9":"A fisherman rushes toward the shore, followed by a swarm of giant sea crabs.","dialogue_season8_10101_1_10":"...","dialogue_season8_10101_1_11":"Perfect! So many giant crabs. They're just...","dialogue_season8_10101_1_12":"The perfect monsters for testing my magic!","dialogue_season8_10101_2_1":"Take this! <color=#ffa352>Arcane Thunder - Upgraded</color>!","dialogue_season8_10101_2_2":"Lightning strikes from the sky, electric sparks flying uncontrollably.","dialogue_season8_10101_2_3":"Oh no... the sand is so damp...","dialogue_season8_10101_2_4":"(A current travels from beneath her feet, and Dorabella wobbles unsteadily.)","dialogue_season8_10101_2_5":"Quickly grabs Dorabella","dialogue_season8_10101_2_6":"You're still shaking. Are you okay?","dialogue_season8_10101_2_7":"Hmm... Don't worry. I just need a moment.","dialogue_season8_10101_2_8":"This is too dangerous. Don't use that move again!","dialogue_season8_10101_2_9":"Well... It's just that the terrain wasn't suitable this time.","dialogue_season8_10101_2_10":"T-Two of you... thank you so much...","dialogue_season8_10101_2_11":"If those giant crabs made it ashore, who knows what kind of trouble they'd cause!","dialogue_season8_10101_2_12":"Your strength is truly impressive. You must be warriors from another land!","dialogue_season8_10101_2_13":"Warriors?","dialogue_season8_10101_2_14":"A powerful Ethereal Valkyrie like me should be considered a warrior, right?","dialogue_season8_10101_2_15":"Indeed, you're warriors. You must be here for the Tournament!","dialogue_season8_10101_2_16":"Then I must tell you...","dialogue_season8_10101_2_17":"To be eligible for the Tournament, it's not just about strength; you also need the <color=#ffa352>Warrior's Seal</color>.","dialogue_season8_10101_2_18":"What? Just like the arena, it requires a ticket?","dialogue_season8_10101_2_19":"Can the Warrior's Seal be bought in the item shop?","dialogue_season8_10101_2_20":"As for how to obtain the Warrior's Seal, there's a poem passed down on our island...","dialogue_season8_10101_2_21":"<color=#ffa352>\"Under the clear moonlight, the spirit cat brings the Warrior's Seal. The warrior's path is fraught with hardship.\"</color>","dialogue_season8_10101_2_22":"Moonlight... spirit cat... Will a cat bring the Warrior's Seal at night?","dialogue_season8_10101_2_23":"What a mysterious island! It's becoming more interesting by the moment.","dialogue_season8_10101_2_24":"Let's go, Omniguardian. Let's explore the coastline of this island first!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_1":"Night falls, and the Omniguardian and Dorabella settle down at an inn.","dialogue_season8_10105_1_2":"Phew, I'm exhausted. After searching all day, I still haven't found any signs of corruption.","dialogue_season8_10105_1_3":"From past experience, the Abyss' corruption can't possibly leave no trace.","dialogue_season8_10105_1_4":"I just can't figure out what's going on with this island...","dialogue_season8_10105_1_5":"Let's rest for now...","dialogue_season8_10105_1_6":"We'll deal with it tomorrow...","dialogue_season8_10105_1_7":"Suddenly, a shadow appears at the window.","dialogue_season8_10105_1_8":"Wait, Omniguardian! Look at the window!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_9":"...","dialogue_season8_10105_1_10":"What a strange cat. Could this be the spirit cat from the island's legend? It's so cute!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_11":"Is it going to bring us the Warrior's Seal like the legend says?","dialogue_season8_10105_1_12":"Hehe, I knew it! Cats and witches have always had a bond!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_13":"...","dialogue_season8_10105_1_14":"The cat jumps down from the window and snatches Dorabella's hat!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_15":"Looks like it didn't come to deliver the Warrior's Seal","dialogue_season8_10105_1_16":"Looks like it's here to steal your hat","dialogue_season8_10105_1_17":"Damn thief cat! Don't touch my hat!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_18":"Meow! (The cat grabs Dorabella's pointed hat and jumps out the window.)","dialogue_season8_10105_1_19":"Hey, don't you dare run!","dialogue_season8_10105_1_20":"Suddenly, a beam of moonlight falls, transforming into a graceful lady with an umbrella, blocking their path.","dialogue_season8_10105_1_21":"Dear guests...","dialogue_season8_10105_1_22":"Beautiful lady, are you an accomplice of that thief cat?","dialogue_season8_10105_1_23":"If you don't move aside, I won't hold back any longer!","dialogue_season8_10105_2_1":"The beautiful lady effortlessly deflects their attacks.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_2":"Distinguished guests from afar, please don't be upset. We mean no harm.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_3":"No harm? That cat just stole my hat!","dialogue_season8_10105_2_4":"If you wish to catch the cat, follow the trail of moonlight.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_5":"I will wait for you there and reveal the truth to you...","dialogue_season8_10105_2_6":"The illusion of the umbrella-bearing lady slowly fades, and the moonlight forms a path.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_7":"Hey! Don't leave... Give me back my hat...","dialogue_season8_10105_2_8":"Normally confident, Dorabella's voice now sounds surprisingly subdued, tinged with bitterness.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_9":"It's fine. You look cute even without your hat.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_10":"(Dorabella remains silent for a while, gently enjoying your touch.)","dialogue_season8_10105_2_11":"Indeed, the hat is a part of Dorabella.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_12":"(Dorabella pushes your hand away.) Hmph...","dialogue_season8_10105_2_13":"I can sense that the lady with the umbrella truly means no harm...","dialogue_season8_10105_2_14":"With no other leads for now, Omniguardian, let's follow the trail of moonlight.","dialogue_season8_10105_2_15":"At least, let's get my hat back!","dialogue_season8_10110_1_1":"Hey, Thief cat! I've finally caught up with you! Stop right there!","dialogue_season8_10110_1_2":"Meow...","dialogue_season8_10110_1_3":"Hold the cat's body with both hand","dialogue_season8_10110_1_4":"Lift the cat by the back of its neck with one hand","dialogue_season8_10110_1_5":"Let go now! You're being rude.","dialogue_season8_10110_1_6":"The cat struggles to break free, leaps to the ground, and transforms into a girl in a blue dress.","dialogue_season8_10110_1_7":"(She hugs her chest with both hands, face flushed) You're... a pervert!!","dialogue_season8_10110_1_8":"A cat that can turn into a human... Well, that doesn't change the fact that you're a thief!","dialogue_season8_10110_1_9":"I'm not a thief! I'm the legendary spirit cat! Though, taking your hat was indeed wrong...","dialogue_season8_10110_1_10":"But it's my master's order! That's more important than right or wrong!","dialogue_season8_10110_1_11":"If you want your hat back, come accept my final test!","dialogue_season8_10110_1_12":"Suits me! I was planning on teaching you a lesson anyway.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_1":"...You win. Here's your hat back.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_2":"Little kitty, your power is impressive, but it still can't match my magic!","dialogue_season8_10110_2_3":"I'm not \"kitty.\" I have a name. It's <color=#ffa352>Schrodinger</color>!","dialogue_season8_10110_2_4":"The mysterious umbrella-bearing lady steps out from behind the door and walks over to Schrodinger.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_5":"Distinguished guests from afar, I am the goddess of Sakura Island, <color=#ffa352>Tsukuyomi</color>.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_6":"To suppress the Abyss's corruption, I am unable to leave the shrine myself. I had no choice but to resort to this method, bringing you here. I sincerely apologize.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_7":"Abyss's corruption?","dialogue_season8_10110_2_8":"This island doesn't seem to be corrupted at all","dialogue_season8_10110_2_9":"We searched along the coast all day and found no traces of corruption...","dialogue_season8_10110_2_10":"Actually, the Abyss's power tainted this island over a thousand years ago...","dialogue_season8_10110_2_11":"But my sister severed the connection between the Abyss and the island using celestial light.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_12":"She then sealed the Abyss's void with the power of three sacred Relics, which is why the island has remained peaceful.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_13":"Your sister is truly powerful, to suppress the Abyss with her own strength.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_14":"However, in the end, even that couldn't withstand the passage of time. Now, the Abyss's void is expanding, and the power of the Relics is gradually weakening.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_15":"If the corruption continues to worsen and the Relics are tainted, the monsters emerging from the Abyss will endanger the entire island!","dialogue_season8_10110_2_16":"You're in luck. Omniguardian and I are here to deal with the Abyss!","dialogue_season8_10110_2_17":"We're professionals when it comes to the Abyss.","dialogue_season8_10110_2_18":"So, you are the Omniguardian... My sister and I have heard much about your esteemed name in the past!","dialogue_season8_10110_2_19":"Now, we will need your assistance for what comes next.","dialogue_season8_10115_1_1":"What stands before you is one of the three sacred Relics, the <color=#ffa352>Magatama</color>!","dialogue_season8_10115_1_2":"Please use your power to activate the Magatama once more and release the Abyss void it has sealed.","dialogue_season8_10115_1_3":"Place your hand on the Magatama","dialogue_season8_10115_1_4":"The Magatama shines with dazzling light.","dialogue_season8_10115_1_5":"The light condenses into a rift that appears before everyone, tearing the space apart.","dialogue_season8_10115_1_6":"Within the rift is a corrupted, ruined world.","dialogue_season8_10115_1_7":"The Abyss's aura from this void is so thick it is almost nauseating.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_1":"Finally, we can resolve this millennium-old affliction. Your power is truly great.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_2":"She bows deeply to the Omniguardian.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_3":"Stop Tsukuyomi from bowing","dialogue_season8_10115_2_4":"Get your hands off Lady Tsukuyomi!","dialogue_season8_10115_2_5":"Schrodinger, don't be rude! The Omniguardian is our benefactor here on Sakura Island.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_6":"They have also passed your test. Now, you must fulfill your duty as the spirit cat and present them with the Warrior's Seal.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_7":"Reluctantly, Schrodinger pulls out the Warrior's Seal and hands it to the two of them.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_8":"Although your techniques do not align with the way of the warrior, especially Omniguardian's Omnideus...","dialogue_season8_10115_2_9":"Your character and strength are enough to be called Warriors.","dialogue_season8_10115_2_10":"So this is the Warrior's Seal... It seems to be filled with a mysterious power!","dialogue_season8_10201_2_1":"It's truly amazing. This Warrior's Seal can continuously unleash power in battle...","dialogue_season8_10201_2_2":"The Warrior's Seal contains the <color=#ffa352>Kishin's Power</color> of Sakura, which grants warriors a boost.","dialogue_season8_10201_2_3":"By the way, we've heard that only those with the seal are eligible to participate in the grand Tournament on the island.","dialogue_season8_10201_2_4":"Haha, you're well-informed. The purpose of the Tournament is to have warriors tap into the Kishin's Power within the seal.","dialogue_season8_10201_2_5":"This power will grant the Relics the strength to suppress the void.","dialogue_season8_10201_2_6":"Of course, for the warriors who participate, Sakura Island will not skimp on rewards!","dialogue_season8_10201_2_7":"The champion warrior will even earn the right to wield the Kusanagi, the Relic that suppresses the Abyss.","dialogue_season8_10201_2_8":"It sounds fun and it clears the Abyss's corruption... I'm almost tempted to participate.","dialogue_season8_10201_2_9":"Then let's go, to win the Tournament...","dialogue_season8_10201_2_10":"Then let's go, to eliminate the Abyss's corruption...","dialogue_season8_10201_2_11":"I believe with both of your strength, you will certainly win!","dialogue_season8_10205_1_1":"Is this the <color=#ffa352>Sakura Tournament</color>? Quite impressive.","dialogue_season8_10205_1_2":"It reminds me of the arena in Mirlond, always bustling with excitement.","dialogue_season8_10205_1_3":"Everyone, I have something to attend to. I'll step out for a bit and catch up with you all later.","dialogue_season8_10205_1_4":"Schrodinger will guide you through the upcoming matches.","dialogue_season8_10205_1_5":"Lady Tsukuyomi, leave it to me!","dialogue_season8_10205_1_6":"As the legendary spirit cat, my martial arts experience is second to none.","dialogue_season8_10205_1_7":"When danger strikes, just stay behind me, little kitty.","dialogue_season8_10205_1_8":"(Transforms into human form) Miss Dorabella! I've told you I have a name! Please call me Schrodinger!","dialogue_season8_10205_2_1":"Sister, it's been a while.","dialogue_season8_10205_2_2":"...","dialogue_season8_10205_2_3":"We finally got to meet, and yet you're so cold.","dialogue_season8_10205_2_4":"...","dialogue_season8_10205_2_5":"Amaterasu's form dissipates into a shadow.","dialogue_season8_10205_2_6":"Though similar, my sister's presence would never feel so faint.","dialogue_season8_10205_2_7":"Could it be...","dialogue_season8_10210_1_1":"On the final arena of the Tournament, a familiar face appears...","dialogue_season8_10210_1_2":"We meet again, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_3":"Master Lee? What are you doing here?","dialogue_season8_10210_1_4":"As a martial warrior, how could I miss such a grand event!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_5":"Master Lee, three-time champion! Master Lee, three-time champion!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_6":"Iron Fist Lee! Divine Staff Master Lee!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_7":"Master Lee, we love you! Master Lee, we love you!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_8":"You won't win easily this time. Master Lee is a three-time champion of the Tournament. His skills are flawless, and he's a true master of martial arts!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_9":"Schrodinger, leave the final opponent to me!","dialogue_season8_10210_1_10":"I already have new inspiration. No matter who the opponent is, as long as I use that move, victory is certain!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_1":"Take this! <color=#ffa352>Arcane Thunder - Ultimate</color>!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_2":"Lightning strikes from the air, sending Master Lee flying out of the arena.","dialogue_season8_10210_2_3":"Hooray! We won!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_4":"That's not really martial arts!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_5":"Can this really be considered martial arts...?","dialogue_season8_10210_2_6":"It probably shouldn't be considered martial arts...","dialogue_season8_10210_2_7":"Hmph... I am a martial warrior, and the spell I released is naturally part of martial arts!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_8":"This is our martial arts!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_9":"As expected, Omniguardian understands me!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_10":"Thanks to both of you, I got to watch a truly innovative martial arts match!","dialogue_season8_10210_2_11":"Now, please follow me to the shrine to take up the <color=#ffa352>Kusanagi</color>, the weapon of the victor.","dialogue_season8_10215_1_1":"The group enters the shrine, only to find it unexpectedly empty.","dialogue_season8_10215_1_2":"Strange, why isn't Lady Amaterasu here?","dialogue_season8_10215_1_3":"Unbelievable! Isn't this supposed to be a celebration? Why is it so quiet...","dialogue_season8_10215_1_4":"No one came to celebrate the champion?!","dialogue_season8_10215_1_5":"Since my sister isn't here, I'll take charge. Take these rewards for now, and let's retrieve the Kusanagi together.","dialogue_season8_10215_1_6":"Slide open the screen behind the shrine's altar","dialogue_season8_10215_1_7":"!","dialogue_season8_10215_1_8":"Lady Amaterasu, so you were here all along.","dialogue_season8_10215_1_9":"Wait... everyone, don't go closer!","dialogue_season8_10215_1_10":"Blinding sword slashes pierce through the screen, rushing straight toward the group!","dialogue_season8_10215_2_1":"Tsukuyomi's crimson umbrella spins, deflecting the sharp blades for everyone.","dialogue_season8_10215_2_2":"This swordsmanship is sharp, but it doesn't compare to the Eternal Light...","dialogue_season8_10215_2_3":"Tsukuyomi thrusts her umbrella toward Amaterasu, and in the next moment, Amaterasu dissolves into an illusion.","dialogue_season8_10215_2_4":"What... what's going on?!","dialogue_season8_10215_2_5":"Lady Amaterasu... just vanished?","dialogue_season8_10215_2_6":"As I suspected...","dialogue_season8_10215_2_7":"Lady Tsukuyomi! That expression... You must know something...","dialogue_season8_10215_2_8":"Alright, alright. It's just a lingering illusion, nothing to worry about...","dialogue_season8_10215_2_9":"What's more pressing is clearing out the Abyss's corruption here.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_1":"Before the empty altar, the Kusanagi is nowhere to be seen.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_2":"Where could the Kusanagi have gone? It's always been here...","dialogue_season8_10301_1_3":"It seems there's only one way.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_4":"Omniguardian, the situation is urgent. I must trouble you to break the seal here.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_5":"But without the Relic, how can we unseal the Abyss void?","dialogue_season8_10301_1_6":"Schrodinger, besides the three sacred Relics, Sakura Island is also protected by my sister and me!","dialogue_season8_10301_1_7":"Omniguardian, I believe in your power. Please...","dialogue_season8_10301_1_8":"Please use me as the Relic.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_9":"Tsukuyomi kneels gracefully, a vision of an untouchable flower atop a distant peak.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_10":"Unhesitatingly, press the Omnideus to Tsukuyomi's forehead.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_11":"Feign hesitation, then press the Omnideus to Tsukuyomi's chest.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_12":"Lady Tsukuyomi... Lady Tsukuyomi...","dialogue_season8_10301_1_13":"Ah...","dialogue_season8_10301_1_14":"Tsukuyomi's body emits a brilliant radiance, akin to that of a Relic.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_15":"The light coalesces into a rift of the Abyss void...","dialogue_season8_10301_1_16":"Omniguardian... Go now, all of you, while I can still maintain this state.","dialogue_season8_10301_1_17":"Hurry, Omniguardian!","dialogue_season8_10301_1_18":"Lady Tsukuyomi...","dialogue_season8_10301_2_1":"Schrodinger displays uncharacteristic bravery, fighting fiercely in the void, drenched in blood.","dialogue_season8_10301_2_2":"Cough! Eliminate the enemies... eliminate...","dialogue_season8_10301_2_3":"Stop charging forward. While there are no monsters swarming us, take a moment to rest.","dialogue_season8_10301_2_4":"But... there are still so many monsters left... I can't let Lady Tsukuyomi suffer out there...","dialogue_season8_10301_2_5":"Dorabella steps forward and pulls Schrodinger into an embrace.","dialogue_season8_10301_2_6":"Alright, stop moving. Look at your wounds. Don't they hurt?","dialogue_season8_10301_2_7":"You need proper rest to fight better.","dialogue_season8_10301_2_8":"Don't rush it. Let me cast a few healing spells first.","dialogue_season8_10301_2_9":"Magic... such a warm feeling, like being back in Lady Tsukuyomi's embrace...","dialogue_season8_10305_1_1":"Everyone, look over there! That red meteor in the sky!","dialogue_season8_10305_1_2":"A crimson star, trailing a blood-red tail, crashes fiercely into the ground from the pitch-black sky.","dialogue_season8_10305_1_3":"What terrifying power. Even the ground is trembling...","dialogue_season8_10305_1_4":"That Abyss aura coming from it feels both familiar and repulsive...","dialogue_season8_10305_1_5":"A surge of overwhelming pressure descends from above as a red-haired woman suddenly appears overhead.","dialogue_season8_10305_1_6":"Such a foul stench. How can remnants of the old world still exist in this new one?","dialogue_season8_10305_1_7":"And you... your body contains the <color=#ffa352>power of the Abyss</color>, yet it reeks of the decayed old world. How disgusting!","dialogue_season8_10305_1_8":"I have nothing to do with the Abyss! I'm a cat of Sakura Island!","dialogue_season8_10305_1_9":"Your excuses mean nothing. The moment I arrived, your fate was already sealed.","dialogue_season8_10305_1_10":"Are you ready? Prepare to meet your death!","dialogue_season8_10305_2_1":"We need to retreat. This enemy's power is far beyond what we can handle in our current state.","dialogue_season8_10305_2_2":"So weak... utterly pathetic...","dialogue_season8_10305_2_3":"Death begins with the traitor.","dialogue_season8_10305_2_4":"Leviathan raises a finger, sending a crimson bolt of lightning hurtling straight at Schrodinger.","dialogue_season8_10305_2_5":"Schrodinger, get out of the way!","dialogue_season8_10305_2_6":"Block the lightning with a sword","dialogue_season8_10305_2_7":"Omniguardian...","dialogue_season8_10305_2_8":"Block the lightning with your body","dialogue_season8_10305_2_9":"Omniguardian, doesn't it hurt...?","dialogue_season8_10305_2_10":"It's been a while since I've seen a heroic Omniguardian saving... a cat.","dialogue_season8_10305_2_11":"Omniguardian, I'm sorry for my earlier rudeness... You're truly a great warrior... a hero.","dialogue_season8_10305_2_12":"But... but next time, could you please not touch Lady Tsukuyomi...","dialogue_season8_10305_2_13":"Haha... so the little kitty is crying because her precious Lady Tsukuyomi was touched...","dialogue_season8_10305_2_14":"A cat's emotions are just so amusing, so adorable... Hahaha...","dialogue_season8_10310_1_1":"The game of running is over, worms.","dialogue_season8_10310_1_2":"How is her power so strong?","dialogue_season8_10310_1_3":"This is the power from the root of the Abyss.","dialogue_season8_10310_1_4":"Not bad! At least you recognize it!","dialogue_season8_10310_1_5":"As your reward!","dialogue_season8_10310_1_6":"This is the power of the Dark Omniguardian!","dialogue_season8_10310_1_7":"Foolish! How dare you compare me to that idiot!","dialogue_season8_10310_1_8":"As your punishment!","dialogue_season8_10310_1_9":"I will cleanse that stench of decay from your bodies with my power!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_1":"Cry out! For your impending demise!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_2":"Crimson lightning surges from her body, shooting toward everyone.","dialogue_season8_10310_2_3":"No... I haven't fulfilled Lady Tsukuyomi's mission yet!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_4":"Do not fear, everyone!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_5":"I won't let her harm you!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_6":"A golden blade of light splits the sky, striking Leviathan's clone and shattering it.","dialogue_season8_10310_2_7":"It's Lady Amaterasu's Eternal Blade!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_8":"So she's Amaterasu... Such overwhelming divine power!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_9":"What?! Amaterasu? You were imprisoned by my true form. How can you appear here?","dialogue_season8_10310_2_10":"...I see now. Though you mimic her well, you are not her.","dialogue_season8_10310_2_11":"I'll remember this. The next time we meet, I'll repay it tenfold!","dialogue_season8_10310_2_12":"Everyone, the Abyss monsters have been eradicated. Let us return!","dialogue_season8_10315_2_1":"Phew! It's such a relief we made it back safely. All thanks to Lady Amaterasu.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_2":"Lady Tsukuyomi... We were almost killed by those Abyss monsters just now. Luckily, Lady Amaterasu arrived just in time!","dialogue_season8_10315_2_3":"Tsukuyomi picks up the cat, her gaze slyly turning toward Amaterasu.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_4":"Hehe, sister! Do you happen to know where the Kusanagi went?","dialogue_season8_10315_2_5":"As expected, Lady Tsukuyomi, nothing escapes you. I am not the true Amaterasu.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_6":"W-what? This Amaterasu is also a fake?","dialogue_season8_10315_2_7":"Why are there so many fake Amaterasus?","dialogue_season8_10315_2_8":"I'm the Kusanagi. Recently, under Lady Amaterasu's orders, I took her form to guard the shrine.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_9":"But the Abyss's corruption had been gradually eroding me, leaving me lost within the void.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_10":"It was only thanks to you, Lady Tsukuyomi, reopening the link between the Abyss and the present world that I was able to find my way back.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_11":"Facing the Abyss for so long must have been hard on you...","dialogue_season8_10315_2_12":"Omniguardian, please use the power of your Omnideus to cleanse the corruption on the Kusanagi.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_13":"Extend the Omnideus","dialogue_season8_10315_2_14":"This power you wield... it burns so intensely...","dialogue_season8_10315_2_15":"The Amaterasu form fades like petals of a spider lily, revealing the sharp blade of the Kusanagi.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_16":"Ahem...","dialogue_season8_10315_2_17":"Alright, now let's proceed to the shrine that protects the Yata no Kagami.","dialogue_season8_10315_2_18":"If I'm not mistaken, my sister should already be there.","dialogue_season8_10401_1_1":"This shrine... How could it be like this?","dialogue_season8_10401_1_2":"It wasn't like this when I came here not long ago...","dialogue_season8_10401_1_3":"It seems the Abyss's corruption has already spread to the present world.","dialogue_season8_10401_1_4":"I can't feel Lady Amaterasu or the presence of the Yata no Kagami at all...","dialogue_season8_10401_1_5":"I'm afraid my sister, with the Yata no Kagami, has entered the void...","dialogue_season8_10401_1_6":"Omniguardian, this is the last time I ask of you. Please lend me your power.","dialogue_season8_10401_1_7":"I don't mind. I'm glad to help.","dialogue_season8_10401_1_8":"...","dialogue_season8_10401_1_9":"Grasp Tsukuyomi's outstretched left hand","dialogue_season8_10401_1_10":"(Raising the Kusanagi in her right hand) By the light of the Ruler of the Night Realm, open the rift between this world and the void!","dialogue_season8_10401_1_11":"The goddess's sharp blade tears through the void, revealing a rift.","dialogue_season8_10401_1_12":"Let's go together, and bring back Lady Amaterasu!","dialogue_season8_10401_1_13":"Enter the final void","dialogue_season8_10405_1_1":"Inside the void, Amaterasu swings her sword, leaving several bone-deep gashes on Leviathan's body.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_2":"To be distracted while fighting me... how bold.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_3":"...Interesting, my clone has lost contact.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_4":"It seems there are other strong beings on Sakura Island, aside from you.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_5":"Amaterasu, I acknowledge your great power.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_6":"But your so-called eternity... will fade away just like these wounds, in the blink of an eye.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_7":"In an instant, all of Leviathan's sword wounds heal.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_8":"Do you see? This is the immortal power of the Abyss! While you, the remnants of the old world, can only face decay and death!","dialogue_season8_10405_1_9":"You speak of the new era, yet you always have the Abyss on your lips, like a good little Abyss child...","dialogue_season8_10405_1_10":"But I firmly believe only one's own power can create true eternity!","dialogue_season8_10405_1_11":"Heh, then let me show you my true power... The Power of Doom! Come forth!","dialogue_season8_10405_1_12":"A giant scarlet phantom falls from the void above, merging with Leviathan's body.","dialogue_season8_10405_1_13":"I hope your sword can stay as firm as your words... After all, it's not easy to find an opponent like you!","dialogue_season8_10405_2_1":"Before Leviathan's powerful onslaught, Amaterasu kneels, supported by her sword.","dialogue_season8_10405_2_2":"To have withstood my assault for so long, Amaterasu, you've earned my respect. I'll probably never forget you!","dialogue_season8_10405_2_3":"So this is the power that touches the very root of the Abyss... I truly underestimated it...","dialogue_season8_10405_2_4":"A sword light, as bright as the full moon, slashes through and halts Leviathan's attack.","dialogue_season8_10405_2_5":"Phew, that was a close call...","dialogue_season8_10405_2_6":"Sister! Why do you always try to handle everything by yourself?","dialogue_season8_10405_2_7":"For the first time, Amaterasu, usually emotionless, shows a look of awkwardness.","dialogue_season8_10405_2_8":"I'm sorry...","dialogue_season8_10405_2_9":"The worms are all gathering...","dialogue_season8_10405_2_10":"Just as I hoped, I'll catch you all in one fell swoop!","dialogue_season8_10405_2_11":"This Leviathan exudes a terrifying force, much stronger than the clone I saw last time...","dialogue_season8_10405_2_12":"Is this Leviathan's true form? It may be the most powerful monster I've ever encountered...","dialogue_season8_10410_1_1":"Take them. These sacred Relics have missed you as well...","dialogue_season8_10410_1_2":"Lady Amaterasu, after a thousand years, we three sacred Relics are finally able to act alongside you again!","dialogue_season8_10410_1_3":"With the full power of the three sacred Relics, I have returned to my peak...","dialogue_season8_10410_1_4":"By the way, everyone, please refrain from intervening in the upcoming battle. Let my sister handle it on her own.","dialogue_season8_10410_1_5":"You understand me best. Leave the battle to me from here on out!","dialogue_season8_10410_1_6":"Can we finally skip the final showdown this time?","dialogue_season8_10410_1_7":"It's a bit of a shame not being allowed to intervene in the final showdown...","dialogue_season8_10410_1_8":"That's Lady Amaterasu... a true battle maniac.","dialogue_season8_10410_1_9":"I see, could this be the real reason she's holding the Tournament?","dialogue_season8_10410_1_10":"Are you done talking? My patience has worn thin with you worms...","dialogue_season8_10410_1_11":"Who should I start with...?","dialogue_season8_10410_1_12":"Leviathan, as a token of our mutual respect, it's time for you to witness my true power.","dialogue_season8_10410_2_1":"Amaterasu... Leviathan... their battle is far beyond anything others can interfere with.","dialogue_season8_10410_2_2":"What kind of magic would I need to invent to contend with beings of their caliber?","dialogue_season8_10410_2_3":"Hah... even as the Ethereal Valkyrie, there are things I can't figure out...","dialogue_season8_10410_2_4":"Impossible! The immortal power of the Abyss is being suppressed by your celestial light!","dialogue_season8_10410_2_5":"My body... it can no longer heal...","dialogue_season8_10410_2_6":"My celestial light comes from within myself, while your so-called immortality is merely a handout from the root of the Abyss.","dialogue_season8_10410_2_7":"Only power born of oneself can endure for all eternity.","dialogue_season8_10410_2_8":"With this Eternal Blade... I grant you death!","dialogue_season8_10410_2_9":"A boundless flurry of blade light coalesces into a single beam of eternal light, cleaving Leviathan apart.","dialogue_season8_10410_2_10":"Hahaha... Amaterasu... Only power born of oneself... what you said is so true...","dialogue_season8_10410_2_11":"Leviathan's form shatters within the celestial light, dispersing into a scarlet phantom that fades away.","dialogue_season8_10415_1_1":"I knew Lady Amaterasu would claim victory!","dialogue_season8_10415_1_2":"I feel inspired! If I design magic based on Amaterasu's celestial light, it might wield immense power...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_3":"Everyone... I fear this battle is far from over!","dialogue_season8_10415_1_4":"The massive dark cloud hasn't dissipated. Instead, it's continuing to condense...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_5":"The dark cloud gradually compresses and transforms into a massive scarlet beast!","dialogue_season8_10415_1_6":"Ah, we meet again, everyone...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_7":"So this is your true form, after all.","dialogue_season8_10415_1_8":"Thanks to you, I have returned to my true self and embraced my power...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_9":"Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am the Doom Harbinger, the Abyss, and the End...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_10":"I shall bring both destruction and rebirth to your world...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_11":"Her power seems identical to that of the Abyss...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_12":"She might very well be a part of the root of the Abyss.","dialogue_season8_10415_1_13":"This is troubling. Our divine powers can suppress the Abyss but cannot truly destroy its root...","dialogue_season8_10415_1_14":"The power of the Abyss's root? Perfect! This is where the Omniguardian comes in!","dialogue_season8_10415_1_15":"The final showdown cannot proceed without me","dialogue_season8_10415_1_16":"I am the Abyss's nemesis","dialogue_season8_10415_1_17":"Sister, the situation is critical. It doesn't allow you to handle this alone!","dialogue_season8_10415_1_18":"Join me in assisting the Omniguardian and help him create an opening to cleanse the Abyss's corruption...","dialogue_season8_10415_2_1":"Is this the power of the legendary Omniguardian? It truly has the ability to dissolve the Abyss's corruption.","dialogue_season8_10415_2_2":"...Such noble power, yet it resides in such a fragile individual...","dialogue_season8_10415_2_3":"Compared to the Dark Omniguardian, a mere vessel of power, your existence is far more intriguing!","dialogue_season8_10415_2_4":"Interesting, despite being worms of the decaying old era, your power is worthy of admiration...","dialogue_season8_10415_2_5":"I hope that when I next awaken from my slumber and become stronger, I will still be able to see you all!","dialogue_season8_10415_2_6":"Leviathan completely dissipates.","dialogue_season8_10415_2_7":"With the crisis averted, the Tournament's award ceremony is being held on Sakura Island.","dialogue_season8_10415_2_8":"Thank you. Thank you for the applause, everyone!","dialogue_season8_10415_2_9":"You can also chant my name, Dorabella.","dialogue_season8_10415_2_10":"Omniguardian, it was you who saved this island. Without you, we might have already been swallowed by the Abyss...","dialogue_season8_10415_2_11":"Such a great favor, it's beyond words...","dialogue_season8_10415_2_12":"Whatever gift you wish for, as long as it's on this island, <color=#ffa352>you can have it</color>...","dialogue_season8_10415_2_13":"Anything at all?","dialogue_season8_10415_2_14":"Look at Tsukuyomi","dialogue_season8_10415_2_15":"Look at Schrodinger","dialogue_season8_10415_2_16":"Ahem... What's on your mind?","dialogue_season8_10415_2_17":"Hey! Omniguardian, what are you thinking about!","dialogue_season8_10415_2_18":"As the cherry blossoms scatter with a fragrance in the air, this beautiful island will once again embrace a long period of peace.","dialogue_main_11240_1_1":"Lady Eluller, it's just so hot here...","dialogue_main_11240_1_2":"Hang in there, Merida.","dialogue_main_11240_1_3":"Look! That strange tower!","dialogue_main_11240_1_4":"Aiushtha is sending her magical energy to call for help!","dialogue_main_11240_2_1":"Omniguardian, it's been so long...","dialogue_main_11240_2_2":"Aiushtha, I'm here.","dialogue_main_11240_2_3":"Aiushtha, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.","dialogue_main_11240_2_4":"I always believed... if I just waited... you would come to save me...","dialogue_main_11240_2_5":"Lady Aiushtha, please conserve your strength and return to the Royal City with us for treatment.","dialogue_season9_10100_1_1":"Omniguardian, the call from beyond the Eternal Gate grows more urgent.","dialogue_season9_10100_1_2":"This time, the undercurrents of the Abyss surge toward the <color=#ffa352>Golden Kingdom</color>, that ancient land buried beneath golden sands.","dialogue_season9_10100_1_3":"It's time to set off again.","dialogue_season9_10100_1_4":"Omniguardian, come with me to the pyramid!","dialogue_season9_10101_1_1":"A massive pyramid stands tall amidst the endless desert sands.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_2":"The halo atop the pyramid shines brilliantly like the sun, emitting dazzling light.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_3":"Such a scorching desert, even hotter than my homeland... Omniguardian, are you holding up okay?","dialogue_season9_10101_1_4":"The aura emanating from that halo is unsettling, as if it holds more than just the power of the sun...","dialogue_season9_10101_1_5":"Let's go check it out","dialogue_season9_10101_1_6":"Just after crossing the windswept sands, the Omniguardian and Bastet are surrounded by a squad of desert guards.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_7":"Stop right there, both of you. Ahead lies the forbidden pyramid grounds. Without the Divine Ruler's permission, no one is allowed to step foot inside.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_8":"\"Judging by your appearance, you two seem to have come from outside the kingdom. You can head over there to the Royal City for a short rest.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_9":"Our Royal City is incredibly prosperous, and every visitor to the kingdom is reluctant to leave.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_10":"We are indeed from outside the kingdom...","dialogue_season9_10101_1_11":"Got you! You're indeed outsiders!","dialogue_season9_10101_1_12":"The soldiers' expressions turn downright ferocious.","dialogue_season9_10101_1_13":"Intruders, prepare to die!","dialogue_season9_10101_1_14":"Watch out! Omniguardian!","dialogue_season9_10101_1_15":"What's wrong with these guards? Why did they suddenly go berserk?...","dialogue_season9_10101_2_1":"(Standing up again) Intruders... must be eliminated...","dialogue_season9_10101_2_2":"These guys? No matter what hits them, they just keep getting back up.","dialogue_season9_10101_2_3":"It seems like they've been infused with the power of the Abyss.","dialogue_season9_10101_2_4":"By <color=#ffa352>Ra's</color> command... Kill... Eliminate them all...","dialogue_season9_10101_2_5":"Omniguardian, let's retreat. There's no point in continuing this confrontation with them.","dialogue_season9_10101_2_6":"Let's check out the Golden City up ahead...","dialogue_season9_10105_1_1":"The two manage to escape into the Golden City, finally evading the guards' pursuit.","dialogue_season9_10105_1_2":"Phew, those soldiers were really persistent... I'm glad we managed to shake them off.","dialogue_season9_10105_1_3":"Such magnificent architecture, truly a prosperous city, yet not a single person in sight...","dialogue_season9_10105_1_4":"It's eerily quiet here","dialogue_season9_10105_1_5":"It's like a ghost town","dialogue_season9_10105_1_6":"Suddenly, the sky turns pitch black.","dialogue_season9_10105_1_7":"Looking up, countless Ra's Barques obscure the horizon...","dialogue_season9_10105_1_8":"Those people on the barques? They're the soldiers from earlier!","dialogue_season9_10105_1_9":"Intruders... Don't even think about escaping!","dialogue_season9_10105_1_10":"Boom!","dialogue_season9_10105_1_11":"With a deafening crash, the barques slam into the city, leveling buildings in every direction.","dialogue_season9_10105_1_12":"Damn it... these guards definitely aren't right in the head...","dialogue_season9_10105_2_1":"This can't go on any longer...","dialogue_season9_10105_2_2":"Omniguardian, I'll create an opening soon, then we'll break through together.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_3":"Despite a grueling battle, Bastet's magic still fails to defeat the soldiers.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_4":"This is troubling. More and more soldiers are surrounding us.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_5":"You two, I can see that you need help...","dialogue_season9_10105_2_6":"These soldiers are the tyrant's lapdogs, granted immortality by the Divine Ruler's power. Purely attacking them is futile.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_7":"To make them stop, we'll need to do this...","dialogue_season9_10105_2_8":"The mysterious woman gestures with her fingers, causing streams of blue light to flow into the soldiers' bodies.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_9":"The soldiers disperse in all directions with vacant expressions, completely ignoring everyone around them.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_10":"Thanks for the save. Your magic is truly remarkable.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_11":"Was that a time stop?","dialogue_season9_10105_2_12":"Was that mind control?","dialogue_season9_10105_2_13":"I just briefly restored their sanity to stop them from disturbing everyone","dialogue_season9_10105_2_14":"(With that dazed look, it doesn't seem like their sanity has been restored at all.)","dialogue_season9_10105_2_15":"I am <color=#ffa352>Isis</color>, the Goddess of Magic from the Golden Kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10105_2_16":"Omniguardian... and this beautiful Valkyrie accompanying you... it was I who summoned you both here...","dialogue_season9_10105_2_17":"You summoned us?","dialogue_season9_10105_2_18":"Follow me. This isn't a place to talk.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_1":"Following Isis's lead, the group passes through a small door within the Golden City and enters a hidden oasis.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_2":"I never expected to find such a beautiful oasis in the Golden City.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_3":"This is a sanctuary I've concealed with my magic.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_4":"It's also the only place of life within the Golden City.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_5":"But why don't I see any signs of life in this oasis?","dialogue_season9_10110_1_6":"Shh... The survivors are merely hiding.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_7":"Ra's minions still tread upon this sanctuary from time to time, attacking the little life that remains...","dialogue_season9_10110_1_8":"When I'm not around, the survivors can only hide to avoid being killed.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_9":"I never imagined the crisis in this world had escalated to such a critical point.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_10":"I summoned you both here precisely to save this world...","dialogue_season9_10110_1_11":"At that moment, a phantom of the pharaoh suddenly appears, lunging toward Isis.","dialogue_season9_10110_1_12":"Isis! Stop being so stubborn!","dialogue_season9_10110_1_13":"Look! These are the minions that have put our last sanctuary in peril!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_1":"Isis... you'll only bring disaster to the kingdom!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_2":"They seem to know you?","dialogue_season9_10110_2_3":"Of course they know me. They've always wanted to kill me and destroy this last sanctuary.","dialogue_season9_10110_2_4":"But I won't lose to them. I will protect this sacred land, forever...","dialogue_season9_10110_2_5":"Alright, the crisis is over now. It's time to let the children come out and get some fresh air.","dialogue_season9_10110_2_6":"The pyramid in Isis's hand emits a blue light, and one by one, survivors emerge from beneath the oasis.","dialogue_season9_10110_2_7":"That's Lady Isis's voice!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_8":"Lady Isis, you've finally returned.","dialogue_season9_10110_2_9":"Alright, children, say hello to our guests!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_10":"(Dazed) Hello, guests!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_11":"(Dazed) Hello, guests!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_12":"Lady Isis, come play with us!","dialogue_season9_10110_2_13":"(Looking at Isis) Lady Isis, I'd like to hear more stories.","dialogue_season9_10110_2_14":"These children only interact with me on a daily basis, so they're a bit shy around strangers like you...","dialogue_season9_10110_2_15":"These surviving children... They seem...","dialogue_season9_10110_2_16":"They seem like puppets...","dialogue_season9_10110_2_17":"They seem like soldiers...","dialogue_season9_10115_1_1":"Isis tells the two about the current state of the Golden Kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_2":"So you're saying that Ra, the Divine Ruler of the Golden Kingdom, has had her divine consciousness corrupted by the Abyss?","dialogue_season9_10115_1_3":"Indeed, that cataclysm brought tremendous destruction to the entire kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_4":"The power of the Abyss broke free from its seal, corrupting the Divine Ruler and turning her into a tyrant.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_5":"The once-prosperous Golden City has turned into an empty ghost town due to the tyrant's evil deeds.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_6":"Only the guards, now her puppets, continue to patrol tirelessly day and night.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_7":"The aura of the Divine Ruler's power does indeed bear some resemblance to the power of the Abyss.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_8":"The Divine Ruler has exiled herself to the depths of the pyramid, seeking to further explore the power of the Abyss.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_9":"To prevent this world from descending into complete corruption, please come with me to the pyramid and find her!","dialogue_season9_10115_1_10":"Do we have to go back to reach the pyramid?","dialogue_season9_10115_1_11":"That won't be necessary. There's a hidden passage in this oasis that leads directly to the forbidden pyramid grounds.","dialogue_season9_10115_1_12":"Everyone, follow me...","dialogue_season9_10115_2_1":"Everyone follows Isis through the hidden passage, arriving at the entrance of the magnificent pyramid.","dialogue_season9_10115_2_2":"Strange... not a single guard in sight. It's become too quiet.","dialogue_season9_10115_2_3":"She's sent all the soldiers to the Golden City. No one's watching over this place for now.","dialogue_season9_10115_2_4":"Omniguardian, now's your chance to use your power to open the gate!","dialogue_season9_10115_2_5":"Touch the gate","dialogue_season9_10115_2_6":"Hesitantly touch the gate","dialogue_season9_10201_1_1":"Inside the pyramid, mountains of gold pile high, with dazzling treasures that catch the eye.","dialogue_season9_10201_1_2":"The treasures of the Golden Kingdom truly live up to their reputation... That ruby crown is absolutely dazzling...","dialogue_season9_10201_1_3":"During the Golden Kingdom's golden age, we gods forged powerful and magnificent accessories from ancient gemstones.","dialogue_season9_10201_1_4":"Later, we bestowed them upon the People of Gold to bless them.","dialogue_season9_10201_1_5":"However, with the passing of those ancestors, these sacred accessories became ownerless treasures, hidden away within the pyramid.","dialogue_season9_10201_1_6":"Can we take them...?","dialogue_season9_10201_1_7":"If you need anything, feel free to help yourselves.","dialogue_season9_10201_1_8":"But right now, the most important thing is to find Ra first...","dialogue_season9_10201_1_9":"The dog-headed guardian deity steps out from the wall painting, blocking the path.","dialogue_season9_10201_1_10":"Treasure thief! The pyramid's riches shall not be defiled. Face your judgment!","dialogue_season9_10201_2_1":"The dog-headed figure dissipates, once again becoming a painting on the wall.","dialogue_season9_10201_2_2":"The deity figures in these murals possess immense power. Fortunately, their movements are quite stiff.","dialogue_season9_10201_2_3":"They were once gods of the Golden Kingdom. After their demise, they came to reside within the murals, continuing to guard the kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10201_2_4":"But now... they've been corrupted by Ra's power, turning into thralls of the Abyss!","dialogue_season9_10201_2_5":"Look, on that mural ahead! It's the tyrant, Ra!","dialogue_season9_10201_2_6":"Is this golden-armored goddess Ra? And who is the figure facing her in the mural?","dialogue_season9_10201_2_7":"She's truly divine and powerful","dialogue_season9_10201_2_8":"She's truly sexy and seductive","dialogue_season9_10201_2_9":"Before being corrupted by the Abyss, she was the wisest and most virtuous of rulers.","dialogue_season9_10201_2_10":"But everything has changed! Now, she is the tyrant who destroyed our prosperous kingdom!","dialogue_season9_10201_2_11":"(I wonder what Ra has done to make Isis hate her this much...)","dialogue_season9_10205_2_1":"After several consecutive battles, the group arrives at the top of the pyramid.","dialogue_season9_10205_2_2":"Phew... This must be the final guardian deity.","dialogue_season9_10205_2_3":"The higher we go, the more powerful the guardian deities we encounter become.","dialogue_season9_10205_2_4":"This journey has been far from easy. No wonder this pyramid has remained untouched by outsiders.","dialogue_season9_10205_2_5":"The shadows of these guardian deities you saw are also far from their prime.","dialogue_season9_10205_2_6":"Just how powerful must Ra be, the one who rules over all the gods...","dialogue_season9_10205_2_7":"No need to worry. The fact that these guardian deities have been awakened only proves Ra's weakness!","dialogue_season9_10205_2_8":"That tyrant has already decayed and withered away. Hmph, she's just putting up a facade to keep us from finding her.","dialogue_season9_10210_1_1":"At the deepest part of the pyramid lies a collapsed altar.","dialogue_season9_10210_1_2":"This altar looks like it hasn't been used in ages, deteriorated to such a state...","dialogue_season9_10210_1_3":"This altar leads to Ra's hidden temple.","dialogue_season9_10210_1_4":"I can rebuild this altar, but it will take some time...","dialogue_season9_10210_1_5":"Did you build this altar?","dialogue_season9_10210_1_6":"What's your relationship with Ra?","dialogue_season9_10210_1_7":"Those are all things of the past now.","dialogue_season9_10210_1_8":"The divine statue on the wall comes to life, and the altar's guardian deity manifests.","dialogue_season9_10210_1_9":"I am the final line of defense for the Sun Goddess. You shall not approach Lord Ra's sacred domain!","dialogue_season9_10210_1_10":"The altar will take some time to rebuild. Please help me defeat her in the meantime.","dialogue_season9_10210_2_1":"Lady Isis... you... won't... succeed...","dialogue_season9_10210_2_2":"Hmph, you supporters of the tyrant have no right to judge me.","dialogue_season9_10210_2_3":"They seem to harbor an intense hatred toward you...","dialogue_season9_10210_2_4":"It's not like that. Their minds are being controlled by Ra, so naturally, they're hostile toward me.","dialogue_season9_10210_2_5":"Let's go. The magic array has been activated. It's time to defeat the tyrant and save the Golden Kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10210_2_6":"...","dialogue_season9_10210_2_7":"Let's go inside and take a look","dialogue_season9_10210_2_8":"Enter the portal","dialogue_season9_10215_1_1":"With a flash of light, the group finds themselves inside the Solar Wheel.","dialogue_season9_10215_1_2":"Found you!","dialogue_season9_10215_1_3":"Isis... you've come here after all...","dialogue_season9_10215_1_4":"Ra, your reign of tyranny is over!","dialogue_season9_10215_1_5":"I will lead the Golden Kingdom into a brand new future.","dialogue_season9_10215_1_6":"Isis, face the reality!","dialogue_season9_10215_1_7":"Stop dragging <color=#ffa352>what's left</color> of the kingdom into the Abyss for your delusional obsession.","dialogue_season9_10215_1_8":"A delusional obsession?","dialogue_season9_10215_1_9":"What's left of the kingdom?","dialogue_season9_10215_1_10":"Omniguardian, don't believe her. She's the true cause of the Golden Kingdom's destruction...","dialogue_season9_10215_1_11":"Only by making her relinquish the Divine Ruler's sovereignty in her corrupted state can this kingdom step out of decay and be reborn.","dialogue_season9_10215_1_12":"So be it, old friend. Even though the sun has gone under.","dialogue_season9_10215_1_13":"Let me awaken you with my final radiance!","dialogue_season9_10215_2_1":"Hmph, how pathetic! Omniguardian, finish her off while you have the chance!","dialogue_season9_10215_2_2":"Do nothing","dialogue_season9_10215_2_3":"Why don't you make your move...","dialogue_season9_10215_2_4":"Ra seems so weak... even her attacks aren't meant to harm us.","dialogue_season9_10215_2_5":"This behavior doesn't seem like that of someone who willingly joined the Abyss, but rather someone who's been corrupted by it.","dialogue_season9_10215_2_6":"You are not from here. It seems you've been deceived by her.","dialogue_season9_10215_2_7":"Driven by her obsession, she was corrupted by the Abyss and used its power to ambush me...","dialogue_season9_10215_2_8":"I hid in the depths of the pyramid to escape her pursuit.","dialogue_season9_10215_2_9":"Isis, I knew something was wrong with you! You've been using us from the very beginning!","dialogue_season9_10215_2_10":"Hehehe... Of course!","dialogue_season9_10215_2_11":"Thanks to you, I was able to enter this pyramid so smoothly!","dialogue_season9_10215_2_12":"But I haven't been corrupted by the Abyss. Instead, I've mastered its power!","dialogue_season9_10215_2_13":"Only someone like me can lead the Golden Kingdom to prosperity!","dialogue_season9_10301_1_1":"Bastet and the Omniguardian stand guard before Ra.","dialogue_season9_10301_1_2":"Isis, you think you're manipulating us, but we've seen through your ambition long ago.","dialogue_season9_10301_1_3":"But thanks to you, we were able to meet Ra and learn the truth behind everything.","dialogue_season9_10301_1_4":"We used each other","dialogue_season9_10301_1_5":"Your conspiracy ends here!","dialogue_season9_10301_1_6":"Omniguardian, be careful. Her power is not as simple as it appears.","dialogue_season9_10301_1_7":"An old woman crushed by the Abyss.","dialogue_season9_10301_1_8":"A silent Omniguardian and a Valkyrie as elusive as a desert cat...","dialogue_season9_10301_1_9":"You're no match for me!","dialogue_season9_10301_1_10":"Oh? Fight us and prove it!","dialogue_season9_10301_2_1":"Damn it, her magic... how can it be so powerful...","dialogue_season9_10301_2_2":"I can't even come close to reaching her...","dialogue_season9_10301_2_3":"Even with all my might, I cannot prevail.","dialogue_season9_10301_2_4":"Alright, alright, let's end the game here...","dialogue_season9_10301_2_5":"Isis snaps her fingers, binding Bastet and the Omniguardian with invisible threads, leaving them unable to move.","dialogue_season9_10301_2_6":"Isis... stop!","dialogue_season9_10301_2_7":"I'm willing to surrender my sovereignty over the Golden Kingdom. They have nothing to do with our affairs, so please let them go.","dialogue_season9_10301_2_8":"If you surrender your sovereignty, I won't kill anyone. I will be the wisest and most benevolent Divine Ruler this kingdom has ever known!","dialogue_season9_10301_2_9":"Ra feebly raises her hand, severing her connection to the Divine Ruler's sovereignty...","dialogue_season9_10301_2_10":"Now, the Divine Ruler's sovereignty is without an owner. If you desire it, take it for yourself.","dialogue_season9_10301_2_11":"Finally... I've finally obtained everything...","dialogue_season9_10301_2_12":"You outsiders, clear out now! Witness the rebirth of the Golden Kingdom in the desert!","dialogue_season9_10301_2_13":"Isis waves her hand, teleporting everyone out of the pyramid and sending them plummeting toward the distant desert.","dialogue_season9_10305_1_1":"Ra spreads his wings, lifting Bastet and the Omniguardian as everyone slowly descends to the sandy ground.","dialogue_season9_10305_1_2":"The Solar Wheel flickers, emitting a dazzling light...","dialogue_season9_10305_1_3":"I wonder just how powerful Isis will become now that she has obtained the Divine Ruler's sovereignty...","dialogue_season9_10305_1_4":"About that sovereignty...","dialogue_season9_10305_1_5":"Just then, a group of soldiers attacks again, interrupting Ra in the middle of her sentence.","dialogue_season9_10305_1_6":"Intruders... must be eliminated...","dialogue_season9_10305_1_7":"How is this possible... Even with you here, these soldiers still attack us.","dialogue_season9_10305_1_8":"These soldiers are merely puppets created by Isis's obsession... How would they recognize me?","dialogue_season9_10305_1_9":"I shall grant them eternal rest!","dialogue_season9_10305_2_1":"Ra's spear swings through the air, emitting a radiance like the sun, purifying the soldiers.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_2":"You seem to be getting better and better.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_3":"In truth, the Divine Ruler's sovereignty is merely a set of shackles that harnesses the power of the People of Gold to suppress the <color=#ffa352>Abyssal Beast</color>.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_4":"But with the fall of the Golden Kingdom, these shackles were corrupted by the Abyss in turn, becoming the source of corruption.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_5":"In the past, most of my power was used to suppress the Abyss, which is how Isis found an opening to ambush me.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_6":"Now that I've relinquished my sovereignty, my power is gradually returning.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_7":"Oh no, if that's the case, would Isis abandon the shackles and break the seal of the Abyss?","dialogue_season9_10305_2_8":"There's no need to doubt Isis in that regard. No one loves the Golden Kingdom more than she does.","dialogue_season9_10305_2_9":"I'm just worried that her power isn't sufficient to sustain the sovereignty.","dialogue_season9_10310_1_1":"Suddenly, the Solar Wheel in the distance flickers, gradually growing dim.","dialogue_season9_10310_1_2":"What's happening over there?!","dialogue_season9_10310_1_3":"A rainbow light shimmers, and Isis appears before the group.","dialogue_season9_10310_1_4":"She's breathing heavily, looking completely exhausted.","dialogue_season9_10310_1_5":"(Panting) Ra, what exactly is the Divine Ruler's sovereignty all about?","dialogue_season9_10310_1_6":"Why can I only sense the Abyss's corruption and feel none of the power from the kingdom's people?","dialogue_season9_10310_1_7":"Isis, when will you face reality?","dialogue_season9_10310_1_8":"The cataclysm has utterly destroyed the Golden Kingdom, with the Abyss's corruption claiming every life!","dialogue_season9_10310_1_9":"We're the only two left alive in the entire kingdom!","dialogue_season9_10310_1_10":"Silence, you tyrant!","dialogue_season9_10310_1_11":"I've hidden my people away, safely protected in the hidden oasis!","dialogue_season9_10310_1_12":"Omniguardian, you've seen them too. They're all still alive!","dialogue_season9_10310_1_13":"But those people...","dialogue_season9_10310_1_14":"They don't look alive at all","dialogue_season9_10310_1_15":"They look like puppets","dialogue_season9_10310_1_16":"Isis, those you've revived are nothing but soulless husks in the end.","dialogue_season9_10310_1_17":"(Panting)... Silence! I will kill you all. I will never allow you to harm my people...","dialogue_season9_10310_2_1":"Isis's power is suppressed by the Divine Ruler's sovereignty, making even the simplest magic difficult to cast...","dialogue_season9_10310_2_2":"...","dialogue_season9_10310_2_3":"You attempted to harness the power of the Abyss to revive the people of the kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10310_2_4":"Yet, unknowingly, your mind was corrupted by it, driving you to madness.","dialogue_season9_10310_2_5":"But, old friend, even then, you did not break the seal of the Abyss.","dialogue_season9_10310_2_6":"This means you haven't forgotten the ancient Oath of the Gods, suppressing that Abyssal Beast beneath the pyramid!","dialogue_season9_10310_2_7":"Hmph, Ra, I won't be deterred by that creature down there.","dialogue_season9_10310_2_8":"Both the Abyss and the Omniguardian are merely tools at my disposal.","dialogue_season9_10310_2_9":"You've greatly underestimated me","dialogue_season9_10310_2_10":"You've greatly underestimated the Abyss","dialogue_season9_10310_2_11":"Well said!","dialogue_season9_10310_2_12":"The goddess who gazes into the Abyss finds the Abyss gazing back at her!","dialogue_season9_10310_2_13":"Who's there?","dialogue_season9_10315_1_1":"Purple mist gradually encircles the desert pyramid.","dialogue_season9_10315_1_2":"Impossible! My power has broken the seal of the pyramid against my will.","dialogue_season9_10315_1_3":"O goddess who dared to wield the Abyss's mighty power, you have been branded with its mark.","dialogue_season9_10315_1_4":"Ugh...","dialogue_season9_10315_1_5":"Isis!","dialogue_season9_10315_1_6":"A cloud of purple mist engulfs Isis, and she vanishes in an instant.","dialogue_season9_10315_1_7":"We're not done yet! Her life is merely the small price paid for a thousand-year seal!","dialogue_season9_10315_1_8":"Now then, let's warm up together...","dialogue_season9_10315_2_1":"Omniguardian, what's wrong? You keep staring at these wyvern corpses.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_2":"It's the power from the root of the Abyss","dialogue_season9_10315_2_3":"The power from the root of the Abyss again! It seems this beast's strength is equally formidable.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_4":"However, such colossal beasts typically cannot fully manifest in our world. Perhaps by defeating these wyverns, we can hinder her for a while.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_5":"This Abyssal Beast, suppressed by the Golden Kingdom, seems quite different from those you mentioned.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_6":"Before the kingdom was even born, the colossal beast known as Bahamut had already appeared in this world.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_7":"Though sealed beneath the earth, her immense power continues to influence the kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_8":"Ra, at least you told the truth!","dialogue_season9_10315_2_9":"The Golden Kingdom was nothing but a thief who stole my power. The cataclysm it brought upon itself was merely the consequence of its theft.","dialogue_season9_10315_2_10":"Oh no, this giant beast has completely broken free from the pyramid's seal...","dialogue_season9_10401_1_1":"The shattered pyramid is nothing but broken walls and crumbling ruins.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_2":"The mighty beast Bahamut exudes an awe-inspiring aura of dominance.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_3":"It's been a while, world... and you wretched living beings.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_4":"You should leave while you still can...","dialogue_season9_10401_1_5":"Let me fight her until the very end...","dialogue_season9_10401_1_6":"Ra, the Omniguardian and I are here to save lives.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_7":"No matter how powerful she may be, we will stand with you against her.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_8":"(Shaking head) Omniguardian, I am the only living being remaining from the Golden Kingdom.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_9":"This world... it has no meaning anymore...","dialogue_season9_10401_1_10":"The Divine Ruler of the Golden Kingdom has actually lost the courage to face the future.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_11":"However, I didn't return to this world to reminisce with you.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_12":"I'm here to pose riddles to the legendary Omniguardian.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_13":"Your raging flames consuming the world hardly suggest you're here to ask questions.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_14":"Just listen to my first riddle.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_15":"<color=#ffa352>It has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening.</color>","dialogue_season9_10401_1_16":"Human","dialogue_season9_10401_1_17":"Correct! It's a <color=#ffa352>human</color>!","dialogue_season9_10401_1_18":"...","dialogue_season9_10401_1_19":"I know you know it. It's a <color=#ffa352>human</color>!","dialogue_season9_10401_1_20":"Bahamut snaps her fingers.","dialogue_season9_10401_1_21":"One by one, the desert dwellers rise from the sand and charge toward the group.","dialogue_season9_10405_1_1":"(Applauding) Well done! You answered the first roddle perfectly!","dialogue_season9_10405_1_2":"Bahamut raises her hand gently, and the surroundings instantly transform.","dialogue_season9_10405_1_3":"Now then, please listen to the second riddle.","dialogue_season9_10405_1_4":"<color=#ffa352>Some try to hide, others attempt to deceive, but time reveals all, and we will always meet.</color>","dialogue_season9_10405_1_5":"Bahamut, we're done listening to your lies and manipulation.","dialogue_season9_10405_1_6":"You've caused the deaths of so many people in the Golden Kingdom!","dialogue_season9_10405_1_7":"Correct! It's <color=#ffa352>Death</color>.","dialogue_season9_10405_1_8":"Death doesn't just symbolize an end, but also a new beginning!","dialogue_season9_10405_1_9":"How can new life be born if you refuse to accept death?","dialogue_season9_10405_1_10":"She snaps her fingers again, and \"Isis\" emerges from a cloud of purple mist, lunging toward the group.","dialogue_season9_10405_1_11":"This goddess, who refuses to accept death, will be your opponent this time!","dialogue_season9_10405_2_1":"Ra's spear shatters Isis's body, releasing a brilliant golden light as radiant as the sun.","dialogue_season9_10405_2_2":"Rest in peace, old friend!","dialogue_season9_10405_2_3":"I will burn out my last radiance, using this colossal beast's life...","dialogue_season9_10405_2_4":"To drag you, myself, and this entire world to the grave!","dialogue_season9_10405_2_5":"So this is Ra's true power... It's like the sun itself has descended to earth.","dialogue_season9_10405_2_6":"With Ra's power, we stand a fighting chance against Bahamut.","dialogue_season9_10405_2_7":"As expected of the Divine Ruler of the Golden Kingdom, she's able to burn her own life to return to such a state...","dialogue_season9_10405_2_8":"Haha, excellent! Now things are getting interesting. This is the atmosphere of a true showdown!","dialogue_season9_10405_2_9":"(Gently raises hand) Then let us proceed together to the final stage.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_1":"What a strange place...","dialogue_season9_10410_1_2":"This is the Abyss void beyond the heavens, the perfect stage for our final battle.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_3":"Well then, listen carefully to my final riddle.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_4":"<color=#ffa352>It is born where there is no wind, branches out where there is no light, and ultimately returns to a place where there is no path.</color>","dialogue_season9_10410_1_5":"This one is so difficult","dialogue_season9_10410_1_6":"Omniguardian, I can't believe you're actually trying to answer that.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_7":"Is it Time? Or perhaps...","dialogue_season9_10410_1_8":"Omniguardian, don't bother answering!","dialogue_season9_10410_1_9":"We can't let her lead us by the nose any longer. Let's just fight her!","dialogue_season9_10410_1_10":"(Silence)","dialogue_season9_10410_1_11":"Ra, why does your expression look so strange?","dialogue_season9_10410_1_12":"Can't figure it out, huh? Ah, what a shame...","dialogue_season9_10410_1_13":"It's <color=#ffa352>Soul</color>!","dialogue_season9_10410_1_14":"Bahamut snaps her fingers again! The light in Ra's eyes suddenly changes color.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_15":"Ra, who moments ago was prepared for a final showdown with Bahamut, now stands by Bahamut's side.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_16":"Souls of the same origin, nurtured by the passage of time, grow into different branches.","dialogue_season9_10410_1_17":"Your final opponent will be another piece of my soul... Ra!","dialogue_season9_10410_2_1":"With a single strike, Ra, now restored to her prime, overwhelms both of them.","dialogue_season9_10410_2_2":"How is this possible... Ra, why?","dialogue_season9_10410_2_3":"What's going on?","dialogue_season9_10410_2_4":"Miss Bastet, this isn't your fault. After all, even I could hardly imagine...","dialogue_season9_10410_2_5":"Noble Ra and dark Bahamut, how could they be two sides of the same coin?","dialogue_season9_10410_2_6":"She was ready to die with me just a moment ago...","dialogue_season9_10410_2_7":"You are all merely parts of the colossal beast","dialogue_season9_10410_2_8":"The complete form of the colossal beast cannot possibly manifest","dialogue_season9_10410_2_9":"As expected of the Omniguardian, it seems you've already met my sisters... Indeed, once the complete beast arrives, the entire world will be crushed beneath it...","dialogue_season9_10410_2_10":"As a reward for answering my riddles, before I send you to your demise...","dialogue_season9_10410_2_11":"I shall reveal to you... the answers about this world!","dialogue_season9_10415_1_1":"A colossal beast born from the Abyss, yearning to escape its bindings and break free from the shackles of the void...","dialogue_season9_10415_1_2":"Isn't the void the most liberated place of all?","dialogue_season9_10415_1_3":"In a place that barely exists, how can one speak of freedom...","dialogue_season9_10415_1_4":"After what seemed like an eternity, the colossal beast finally found a fragment of the Shattered Realm and buried herself there.","dialogue_season9_10415_1_5":"Her flesh transformed into endless sands, her power became natural phenomena, and her soul nurtured all life in the world...","dialogue_season9_10415_1_6":"All she has left is her final obsession: me. She banished me underground, waiting for the day of my return.","dialogue_season9_10415_1_7":"So, the Golden Kingdom was actually birthed by this beast...","dialogue_season9_10415_1_8":"Indeed, her death gave birth to the Golden Kingdom, and the destruction of the Golden Kingdom will give birth to us once more.","dialogue_season9_10415_1_9":"This world, transformed by her very existence, will become the void's gateway into reality.","dialogue_season9_10415_1_10":"This place can accommodate powers from all dimensions, whether they exist in reality or in the void.","dialogue_season9_10415_1_11":"At this moment, I will show you the true meaning of the power from the root of the Abyss.","dialogue_season9_10415_1_12":"The power that encompasses both the void and reality... This isn't good for the Omniguardian...","dialogue_season9_10415_1_13":"Is this truly the power that encompasses everything?","dialogue_season9_10415_1_14":"Power from any dimension, any world?","dialogue_season9_10415_1_15":"Omniguardian, give it everything you've got! Struggle all you want!","dialogue_season9_10415_1_16":"I've made it this far relying only on myself","dialogue_season9_10415_1_17":"I've made it this far thanks to the heroes","dialogue_season9_10415_1_18":"Omnideus! Unleash the Eternal Oath!","dialogue_season9_10415_1_19":"Come forth, heroes!","dialogue_season9_10415_1_20":"Leviathan... Amaterasu... Tsukuyomi... Chang'e... Hecate... Gaia...","dialogue_season9_10415_1_21":"Transcending time and dimensions, the power of countless heroes projects into this world.","dialogue_season9_10415_2_1":"Gods... the Abyss... heroes... colossal beasts... all under your control...","dialogue_season9_10415_2_2":"You... what kind of existence are you? I have never seen such power, even in the one who gave birth to me.","dialogue_season9_10415_2_3":"I refuse to become your underling! How is that any different from being a puppet!","dialogue_season9_10415_2_4":"Heh... Since true freedom can't be found even here, I'd rather perish in the void...","dialogue_season9_10415_2_5":"(I'll get you via summons soon)","dialogue_season9_10415_2_6":"...","dialogue_season9_10415_2_7":"Omniguardian! Stop looking and take cover! She's about to self-destruct!","dialogue_season9_10415_2_8":"Bahamut transforms into a brilliant purple speck of light, then violently bursts apart...","dialogue_season9_10415_2_9":"Her power and form once again shatter into fragments, scattering across the continent.","dialogue_season9_10415_2_10":"Her divided soul disintegrates in the yellow sand, falling into the bodies of those children at the oasis.","dialogue_season9_10415_2_11":"Before long, I believe this world will once again welcome new life.","dialogue_season9_10415_2_12":"And this time, the world will bear no trace of this colossal beast.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_1":"Following Elune's trail, the Omniguardian arrives at a vast canyon.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_2":"As the Omniguardian cautiously moves forward, Elune's voice echoes from atop the cliff.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_3":"Well... that's a difficult question to answer...","dialogue_season10_10101_1_4":"No rush, I still have some time!","dialogue_season10_10101_1_5":"I just want to know what your favorite food is and what kind of cave you live in.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_6":"Uh, am I asking too many questions? This is my first time meeting someone from another race, so I'm a bit excited...","dialogue_season10_10101_1_7":"Elune, have you made a new friend?","dialogue_season10_10101_1_8":"Who's there?","dialogue_season10_10101_1_9":"The figure conversing with Elune reveals itself. It's a young wyvern with gleaming scales.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_10":"Oh! Are you the human Lord Mushkhushshu mentioned?!","dialogue_season10_10101_1_11":"You have ten fingers between both hands! No wonder you can craft such beautiful armor and weapons!","dialogue_season10_10101_1_12":"Don't you get the runs from eating cooked meat? I once stole a hunter's smoked sausage and ended up burning through half a granary!","dialogue_season10_10101_1_13":"Oh, and I've heard that human dwellings are just drafty piles of hay.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_14":"Our castle has stained glass windows thirty meters tall.","dialogue_season10_10101_1_15":"Whoa?!","dialogue_season10_10102_1_1":"Omniguardian, please forgive this little one's rashness... it just wants to be friends with us.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_2":"I am Lahmu, servant of Tiamat, Mother of Wyverns!","dialogue_season10_10102_1_3":"The little wyvern proudly breathes out a plume of fire, then sluggishly scratches its snout.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_4":"Haha, truth is, I only ever saw Mother Tiamat once... and that was from behind a thousand dragon backsides.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_5":"Today was such a fun experience. I wish I could take you back with me...","dialogue_season10_10102_1_6":"However, this will displease Lord Mushkhushshu.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_7":"Lord Mushkhushshu believes humans are a weak species and doesn't allow us to play with them...","dialogue_season10_10102_1_8":"Stop right there! Don't talk badly about that wyvern behind its back. You might summon it here.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_9":"At the next moment, birds all around suddenly scatter, flapping their wings as they flee.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_10":"A shadow looms over the canyon as a massive wyvern folds its wings and lands beside the group.","dialogue_season10_10102_1_11":"Just what I was afraid of...!!","dialogue_season10_10102_1_12":"Lahmu, I sent you to find materials! How dare you slack off here?","dialogue_season10_10102_1_13":"Wait a moment... Damn it! These worthless human vermin are trying to trick the dragon heirs?!","dialogue_season10_10102_1_14":"How dare you insult my Omniguardian like that!","dialogue_season10_10102_1_15":"Elune strides forward, crisis imminent!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_1":"As tensions escalate, Lahmu nervously steps forward.","dialogue_season10_10103_1_2":"Lord Mushkhushshu, it's a misunderstanding. I only wanted to learn stories from other races...","dialogue_season10_10103_1_3":"Mighty dragons need not concern themselves with the crawling insects below!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_4":"B-but...","dialogue_season10_10103_1_5":"How dare you talk back?!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_6":"In rage, the Great Wyvern Mushkhushshu swings its claw at Lahmu, indifferent to whether it will cause harm.","dialogue_season10_10103_1_7":"Elune, stop it!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_8":"Stop! It's just a child, and you'll hurt it!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_9":"This is a world for the strong! There's no place for children!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_10":"You coward!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_11":"Elune breaks the Great Wyvern Mushkhushshu's assault, the violent clash sending Lahmu flying.","dialogue_season10_10103_1_12":"Didn't you say I wouldn't get hurt?!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_13":"Impossible! How could mere mortal steel harm a noble dragon...?","dialogue_season10_10103_1_14":"Who's the vermin now?","dialogue_season10_10103_1_15":"You...!!","dialogue_season10_10103_1_16":"Suddenly, the sound of wind in the distance seems to cease.","dialogue_season10_10103_1_17":"Cut it out.","dialogue_season10_10103_1_18":"The sky suddenly radiates a blinding light as Tiamat's arrival makes the mountain buckle under her immense weight. A scorching aura spreads across the land.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_1":"This ruler of the skies exudes such fearsome power that the group can barely breathe.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_2":"M-Mother!","dialogue_season10_10104_1_3":"O-Omniguardian...!","dialogue_season10_10104_1_4":"Stop, Tiamat!","dialogue_season10_10104_1_5":"To remain so calm in my presence... you've earned the right to speak with me.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_6":"But that alone is not enough. You cannot command me, only persuade me.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_7":"And what reason will you use to persuade me?","dialogue_season10_10104_1_8":"I don't mind you testing my strength, but my companions' safety is where I draw the line.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_9":"...Interesting, this is the first time I've heard such an excuse.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_10":"Tiamat's scrutinizing gaze reveals undisguised appreciation.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_11":"Mother Tiamat! Mother, I haven't lost yet! These humans defeated me through their despicable ambush!","dialogue_season10_10104_1_12":"I beg you, grant me greater power, power that will make these humans bow before me.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_13":"Even if I granted you power ten times greater than what you have now, you still wouldn't win.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_14":"Ambition requires wisdom to match it, yet you're lazy enough to judge everything by race.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_15":"My child has made a fool of himself in front of you.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_16":"Omniguardian, your courage and strength are truly impressive.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_17":"As a welcome gift, my kingdom is now open to you. You and your companions may freely roam within.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_18":"You can also consider this as a token of gratitude.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_19":"My children have grown up within the tribe and haven't yet had the chance to meet the powerful beings they are destined to encounter.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_20":"Your arrival, however, showed them the ultimate truth of survival.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_21":"Powerful humans command respect; weak wyverns bring only shame.","dialogue_season10_10104_1_22":"Only power is everything.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_1":"Across the Ice Field, wind and snow howl.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_2":"It seems this blizzard won't subside anytime soon...","dialogue_season10_10201_1_3":"Omniguardian, I've found a cabin where we can shelter from the snow. Please follow me!","dialogue_season10_10201_1_4":"A knock at the door, and it opens. Elwyn, the owner of the cabin, warmly welcomes them inside.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_5":"Please make yourselves at home, honored guests.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_6":"This is just a simple cabin. Find a comfortable spot to rest.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_7":"Thank you. You seem to be from the Ice Field clan?","dialogue_season10_10201_1_8":"Yes.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_9":"I heard that Lord Behemoth, ruler of the Ice Field, allowed his people to hibernate to withstand the crimson cataclysm.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_10":"Why didn't you slumber with your kin, choosing instead to remain here alone?","dialogue_season10_10201_1_11":"I'm waiting for my beloved.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_12":"This cabin is the \"home\" we promised each other.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_13":"But unlike me, my beloved is not of the Ice Field clan, and cannot journey with me to the distant spring...","dialogue_season10_10201_1_14":"I see... So where is your beloved now?","dialogue_season10_10201_1_15":"Due to circumstances beyond her control... she couldn't make it here.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_16":"That sounds strange.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_17":"If that girl likes you, this is an issue you two should face together.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_18":"...Sigh, I suppose there's no harm in telling you the truth.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_19":"My beloved is frail and sickly, so I will take her to a warmer land to recuperate.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_20":"Lord Behemoth shows no mercy to outsiders, but if heroes like you were to plead on her behalf...","dialogue_season10_10201_1_21":"Esteemed guest, I beg you to appeal to the merciless ruler of the Ice Field on my behalf, to grant an additional hibernation permit...","dialogue_season10_10201_1_22":"I'm willing to sacrifice everything if you agree.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_23":"Meeting with Lord Behemoth was already part of our itinerary.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_24":"I will relay your petition to Behemoth, but I cannot guarantee the outcome you desire.","dialogue_season10_10201_1_25":"This is enough. Even the faintest hope is better than none...","dialogue_season10_10202_1_1":"Deep within the Ice Field, snow and wind fill the sky, yet all remains silent as in slumber.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_2":"I hear a sound different from falling snow.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_3":"Reveal yourselves, unknown visitors, if you come seeking an alliance to resist the calamity.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_4":"That is indeed our purpose.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_5":"Additionally, we have brought you the voices of your people.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_6":"Please speak. Listening is a virtue, and I would be delighted to help them in any way I can.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_7":"(Whispers) She doesn't seem as merciless as Elwyn made her out to be...","dialogue_season10_10202_1_8":"Elune explains what happened.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_9":"No external force can tear apart a loving couple, unless...","dialogue_season10_10202_1_10":"Behemoth smiles pensively as a crystalline ice flower blooms in the Omniguardian's palm.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_11":"Please accept this. It serves as a hibernation permit and carries my blessing for them.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_12":"Whoever brings this flower to the Ice Field will be granted sanctuary, just as I would offer my own people.","dialogue_season10_10202_1_13":"As for the story's conclusion...","dialogue_season10_10202_1_14":"Go and witness it yourself.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_1":"The ice flower appears delicate, yet with steadfast tenacity, it accompanies everyone into a strange new realm.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_2":"By the roaring fireplace, a girl gently rubs her nearly frostbitten fingers.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_3":"Are you Elwyn's lover?","dialogue_season10_10203_1_4":"Are you... messengers from the Ice Field?","dialogue_season10_10203_1_5":"What are you doing here? That stalker still hasn't given up?","dialogue_season10_10203_1_6":"Stalker?","dialogue_season10_10203_1_7":"...It seems the truth differs from what Elwyn said.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_8":"We've only met once at the border market.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_9":"I saw him fall, so I lent him a hand... Never expected he'd completely misread my intentions.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_10":"Tell that poor soul to stop bothering me.","dialogue_season10_10203_1_11":"I'd rather battle a hundred winters than be frozen in his lovesick dreams!","dialogue_season10_10203_1_12":"Omniguardian, let's go back and get the truth from Elwyn.","dialogue_season10_10204_1_1":"Upon returning to the snow-covered cabin, they find Elwyn frozen like a statue.","dialogue_season10_10204_1_2":"His final expression... is a surprisingly fulfilled smile.","dialogue_season10_10204_1_3":"At least in his dreams, she will forever \"love\" him?","dialogue_season10_10204_1_4":"No, even in his dreams, there is only endless pursuit...","dialogue_season10_10204_1_5":"Some warmth is never meant for the cold winter","dialogue_season10_10204_1_6":"The ice flower dissipates in the Omniguardian's hand, as if it had long foreseen the lies of this false romance.","dialogue_season10_10204_1_7":"From it, Elwyn's obsessive mutterings faintly emerge.","dialogue_season10_10204_1_8":"She must love me... must... forever...","dialogue_season10_10301_1_1":"The setting sun bathes the village by the volcano in a bloodstained halo.","dialogue_season10_10301_1_2":"A boy of about twelve wields a wooden sword, slashing at the tattered scarecrow before him.","dialogue_season10_10301_1_3":"...Three hundred ninety-nine... Four hundred!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_4":"(Panting)... My strength is fading...","dialogue_season10_10301_1_5":"The boy wipes away sweat with trembling hands, looking toward the rumbling volcano in the distance before gritting his teeth and picking up his sword once more.","dialogue_season10_10301_1_6":"Just a little longer... I can't hold everyone back...!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_7":"The wooden sword swings again, only to be parried by Elune's weapon.","dialogue_season10_10301_1_8":"Child, your stance is incorrect. When executing a backhand strike, your elbow should be raised two inches higher.","dialogue_season10_10301_1_9":"W-who are you? Wait... could you be the monsters from the volcano?!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_10":"We're just ordinary travelers passing by","dialogue_season10_10301_1_11":"Ordinary travelers? You're skilled with a sword, and your demeanor is so distinguished... Could you be knights of the kingdom?!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_12":"The kingdom has finally noticed our pleas! Those monsters from the volcano won't be causing trouble anymore!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_13":"Monsters from the volcano?","dialogue_season10_10301_1_14":"Well, ever since that strange earthquake a few months ago, the monsters from the volcano have become increasingly aggressive!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_15":"They've started frequently attacking villages and farmlands. Just a few days ago, they tried to steal our food supplies...","dialogue_season10_10301_1_16":"The adults all say the volcano is about to erupt, which is why the monsters trapped inside have escaped...","dialogue_season10_10301_1_17":"But I think perhaps something in the volcano got sick, and that's what created those monsters...","dialogue_season10_10301_1_18":"Have you investigated inside the volcano?","dialogue_season10_10301_1_19":"We're too short-staffed and don't have the strength for this...","dialogue_season10_10301_1_20":"We'll go investigate the source of the earthquake","dialogue_season10_10301_1_21":"Thank you so much! Then I'll... I'll prepare some food for your journey!","dialogue_season10_10301_1_22":"Make sure to tell me what's wrong with the volcano when you get back!","dialogue_season10_10302_1_1":"What falls from the volcano's mouth is not ash, but some kind of black snowflakes, cold as if from alien visitors.","dialogue_season10_10302_1_2":"This isn't volcanic ash... This volcano is already dead.","dialogue_season10_10302_1_3":"The rumbling we heard earlier wasn't the sound of volcanic activity either.","dialogue_season10_10302_1_4":"This volcano... no...","dialogue_season10_10302_1_5":"This \"fortress\" disguised as an active volcano exists to cover up certain things.","dialogue_season10_10302_1_6":"Continue exploring","dialogue_season10_10302_1_7":"As they venture deeper into the volcano, the path suddenly opens to reveal what appears to be a man-made tunnel.","dialogue_season10_10302_1_8":"Omniguardian, look! There's a... meteor crater?","dialogue_season10_10302_1_9":"Be careful, Omniguardian! I can sense a deadly aura approaching!","dialogue_season10_10302_1_10":"Before the words finish, dozens of grotesque monsters surge forth from the meteor crater!","dialogue_season10_10302_1_11":"These monsters possess a unique power... unlike any enemy we've encountered in this world before!","dialogue_season10_10302_1_12":"Could it be... that they fell into this world along with the meteor?!","dialogue_season10_10302_1_13":"The group valiantly repels the monsters crawling out from the crater.","dialogue_season10_10302_1_14":"But as the final monster falls, the entire volcano begins to shake violently!","dialogue_season10_10302_1_15":"Impossible! This is clearly a dormant volcano...","dialogue_season10_10302_1_16":"Her voice is drowned out as the molten lava consumes every sound with overwhelming force.","dialogue_season10_10303_1_1":"Rising with the molten lava into the sky, a crimson figure with six obsidian wings unfolds its presence.","dialogue_season10_10303_1_2":"...","dialogue_season10_10303_1_3":"You don't belong in this world either.","dialogue_season10_10303_1_4":"Could they be refugees from another world?","dialogue_season10_10303_1_5":"Who are you?","dialogue_season10_10303_1_6":"My divine name perished in days long past.

The guards can testify to that.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_13":"Deputy Commander Daswind, entrusting us with investigating the commander's cause of death is perhaps unwise.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_14":"Sorry, I don't mean to disturb you and the noble Omniguardian.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_15":"But it was our commander who was murdered, and everyone present except you is a suspect.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_16":"Besides, you are a guest personally invited by Lady Tiamat, so you have the right to command us.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_17":"I will use this privilege wisely","dialogue_season10_10401_1_18":"Allow me to introduce you to Commander Olden's relationships within the legion.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_19":"Commander Olden was highly respected within the legion and had good relationships with almost everyone.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_20":"The only exception was a seasoned soldier named Gareth.","dialogue_season10_10401_1_21":"He's a notorious \"surrenderer.\"","dialogue_season10_10402_1_1":"\"Surrenderer\" Gareth... What does that mean?","dialogue_season10_10402_1_2":"As a soldier, Gareth is exceptionally valiant and skilled in combat; as a man, he knows how to charm the ladies.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_3":"However, he was once a servant of Behemoth.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_4":"Commander Olden captured him on the battlefield, finally freeing him from the stench of beast dung that had clung to him.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_5":"But he doesn't know the meaning of gratitude, always contradicting the commander.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_6":"What would be Gareth's motive?","dialogue_season10_10402_1_7":"Rumor has it that he's still in contact with Behemoth's spy... an Ice Field native posing as a weapon merchant.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_8":"As you know, the Ice Field natives have never gotten along with us.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_9":"Those self-deluded fools, dreaming of freezing the entire world before calamity's arrival...","dialogue_season10_10402_1_10":"I think their brains must have been the first to freeze.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_11":"My scouts discovered that they hold secret meetings at the weapon shop around this time every week.","dialogue_season10_10402_1_12":"It seems the timing is perfect?","dialogue_season10_10402_1_13":"Let's go hear how Gareth and that \"merchant\" will respond.","dialogue_season10_10403_1_1":"The Deputy Commander's troops surround the weapon shop, their gleaming blades encircling Gareth and the \"merchant.\"","dialogue_season10_10403_1_2":"Caught you red-handed!

You have no evidence whatsoever!","dialogue_season10_10404_1_2":"Unfortunately for you, I do. How could you assume Commander Olden was alone when you ambushed him?","dialogue_season10_10404_1_3":"Are you saying...?!","dialogue_season10_10404_1_4":"Yes! At the time of the murder, Commander Olden was communicating with me through a unique Ice Field communication crystal.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_5":"And you just happened to barge in at that moment.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_6":"My ice crystal has recorded your entire crime.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_7":"Since you insist you're innocent, you surely won't mind if I play this video for everyone?","dialogue_season10_10404_1_8":"The merchant pulls out an ice crystal from his pocket, while the deputy commander's eyes flash with murderous intent as he draws his sword!","dialogue_season10_10404_1_9":"It seems the real culprit is someone else. Merchant, look out!","dialogue_season10_10404_1_10":"A cold glint flashes as the blade lunges straight for the merchant's throat!","dialogue_season10_10404_1_11":"The next moment, the merchant in peril reveals his dragon form, seizes the deputy commander, and repels the approaching soldiers.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_12":"The ice crystal is fake, you fool, and you fell for it so easily.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_13":"I am a dragon under Lady Tiamat's command, tasked with serving as her emissary between land and sky.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_14":"Who do you think you are, daring to interfere with Mother's plans...","dialogue_season10_10404_1_15":"If the Laws of the Sky didn't require proof, I'd snap your head off right now!","dialogue_season10_10404_1_16":"This merchant from the Ice Field is actually a dragon...","dialogue_season10_10404_1_17":"Sounds like Tiamat and Behemoth have been in contact for some time...","dialogue_season10_10404_1_18":"This certainly reveals more behind-the-scenes information...","dialogue_season10_10404_1_19":"After a brief interrogation, Daswind confesses to murdering Commander Olden for power.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_20":"After being thrown into the dungeon, he quickly takes poison to end his own life.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_21":"At dawn the next day, Gareth dons the crimson cloak inherited from the previous commander and stands before the Omniguardian's tent.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_22":"Thank you for your help, Omniguardian.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_23":"You are now the new commander of the legion","dialogue_season10_10404_1_24":"This appointment comes directly from Lady Tiamat herself.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_25":"As expected","dialogue_season10_10404_1_26":"Gareth offers a knowing smile, conveying all that needs to be said without a word.","dialogue_season10_10404_1_27":"Well then, allow me to handle your upcoming visit itinerary.","dialogue_season10_10501_1_1":"Omniguardian, Elune! You're here at the perfect time. I've made significant progress in my research.","dialogue_season10_10501_1_2":"Look! I've awakened the energy within the crystal core left behind by the colossal beasts.","dialogue_season10_10501_1_3":"The crystal core within the magic vessel radiates waves of crimson-purple light...","dialogue_season10_10501_1_4":"Its power seems unstable, even distorting the very fabric of space...","dialogue_season10_10501_1_5":"This is precisely what makes this crystal core so extraordinary.
